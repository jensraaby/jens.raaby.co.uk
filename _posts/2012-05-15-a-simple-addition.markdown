Take your standard Italian style tomato sauce recipe, and add one simple ingredient: lemon zest.

Here's the rough list of ingredients I often use:



	
  * olive oil

	
  * 500g beef mince (or better: mixed veal and pork mince)

	
  * 2 tins plum tomatoes

	
  * 1 onion

	
  * 2 cloves garlic

	
  * the zest of half a lemon

	
  * a splash of Worcestershire sauce

	
  * salt and pepper

	
  * oregano


Making a sauce with these ingredients is fairly straightforward. I am also partial to Antonio Carluccio's recipe ["Tagliatelle al Ragu Bolognese"](http://www.antonio-carluccio.com/Tagliatelle_al_Ragu_Bolognese)Â which creates a really nice subtle medley of flavours. If you try adding lemon zest to that it's also very nice.

I love the power of small changes like this. It applies equally to software. Stop and think when your app/website is frustrating you. How can you make it just a little better?
