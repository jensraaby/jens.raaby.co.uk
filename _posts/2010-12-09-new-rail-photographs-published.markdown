I have recently uploaded a collection of rail photographs from the last year or so. While it may not be of interest to that many visitors to this site, I hope some people enjoy them. Browsing some of the older photographs makes we want to delete them, but I don't think it's fair to erase historic records from the public domain like that. I may migrate photos to an archive on Google's Picasaweb service, and only keep the better (generally the newer) work on this domain.
