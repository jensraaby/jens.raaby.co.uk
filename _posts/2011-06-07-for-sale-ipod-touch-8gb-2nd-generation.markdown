I am currently saving up for a new mobile phone, which will probably be an Apple iPhone 5 in September. As a result my iPod will no longer be needed, so I am offering it to anyone interested for the current eBay market value, around Â£70, or nearest offer.

It's in good condition, with the usual scratches on the back, with a couple of very small lines on the front, the longest of which is approximately 2mm.
