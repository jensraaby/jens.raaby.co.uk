You've reached the online home of Jens Raaby, a MSc student at the University of Copenhagen and a 2011 graduate of [Computer Science (University of York)](http://www.cs.york.ac.uk).

You can find my blog under [journal](http://jens.raaby.co.uk/journal/). I mainly write about technological topics, with the odd foray into my other interests.

There are links to my [online photos](http://jens.raaby.co.uk/photographs/), while I work on a more integrated portfolio for this website.


I'm in the process of moving this site over to the Octopress static site generator. Please leave a comment if you find anything broken on the site.
