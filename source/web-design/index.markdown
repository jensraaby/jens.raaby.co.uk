I have been building websites for almost a decade now; it's a fantastic combination of the technical and the artistic. I particularly enjoy constructing visual designs using the latest technology, while trying to communicate in a simple, appealing way.

In the past I have built websites by request to fit around my other work and studies. My clients are typically small businesses - you can see some of their websites below. If you are interested in working with me with an online project, please feel free to get in touch.

I have experience with developing and setting up content management systems (CMS), and I like to build websites which are from the outset search engine optimised (SEO). I can write copy and take photographs as necessary. Recently I have been working on small scale e-Commerce and in the future I will be able to provide development for mobile platforms (native apps for Android/iOS as well as cross platforms web-apps).
