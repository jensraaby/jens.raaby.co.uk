You've reached the online home of Jens Raaby, a MSc student at the University of Copenhagen and a 2011 graduate of [Computer Science (University of York)](http://www.cs.york.ac.uk).

You can find my blog under [journal](http://jens.raaby.co.uk/journal/). I mainly write about technological topics, with the odd foray into my other interests.

There are links to my [online photos](http://jens.raaby.co.uk/photographs/), while I work on a more integrated portfolio for this website.

If you are interested in working with me on a website project, there is also a [section for that](http://jens.raaby.co.uk/web-design/). As a computer scientist, I can also take on programming and software engineering work. I have a year of professional experience developing software in a Human Factors group in a major company, and generally my view on development is to put the user first.
