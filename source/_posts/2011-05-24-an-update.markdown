I'm a little behind on my web design blog posts, but don't worry, there are drafts in progress.

At the moment I am in the run up to my last exam, a 3 hour Real Time Systems paper which is worth approximately 9% of my degree - yikes!

Consequently any blogging over the next few weeks will be procrastination. I am working on a few posts at the moment:



	
  * The website redesign

	
  * Railway photography tutorial/guide

	
  * Reflections on using Windows after adjusting to OS X

	
  * iPad drawing and art


Hopefully they will be posted sooner rather than later.
