Today I took a few photos but nothing different enough to the earlier images. Instead I dug out a photo from July and did some editing with Snapseed, a handy but fairly limited photo editor which has Nik's control point technology for local adjustments.
The subject is a glasswinged butterfly in Chester zoo. It was a couple of weeks after I had purchased my macro lens and my first encounter with an interesting stationary insect.

This coming week I won't be posting every day. I will try to write something but I don't intend to subject myself to a daily posting schedule just yet. I'd like to write something about my quest for a new mobile phone and perhaps a discussion on creativity and procrastination, but we shall see if I can avoid the latter ;~p.
