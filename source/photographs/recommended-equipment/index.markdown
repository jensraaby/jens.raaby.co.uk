I personally recommend or use the following photographic equipment. I'll add more details to the lenses section soon.


## Cameras





	
  * [Nikon D3s](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B002SG7I8Q/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=jenraa-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=B002SG7I8Q)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=jenraa-21&l=as2&o=2&a=B002SG7I8Q)
- Best low light camera, very good ergonomics and handling

	
  * [Nikon D700](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B001BYMC5K/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=jenraa-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=B001BYMC5K)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=jenraa-21&l=as2&o=2&a=B001BYMC5K)
- Expecting an update soon, this would be my ideal camera for everyday serious photography

	
  * [Nikon D7000](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00437RK7C/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=jenraa-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=B00437RK7C)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=jenraa-21&l=as2&o=2&a=B00437RK7C)
- The best DX camera Nikon has made, but still a little expensive

	
  * [Nikon D200](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B000CDG4UK/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=jenraa-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=B000CDG4UK)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=jenraa-21&l=as2&o=2&a=B000CDG4UK)
* - my current DSLR, hoping to replace with a full frame model when it needs retiring

	
  * Nikon F90 * - very sturdy AF film SLR, but not as nice as the F100 or F6.

	
  * Nikon FE * - nice compact manual film SLR, compatible with lots of lenses. Very bright viewfinder




## Lenses


Some of these are lenses I own and use (marked with *), others are ones I have used in the past and would like to have.



	
  * [Nikon Zoom-Nikkor 12-24mm F/4G](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B000092M1T/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=jenraa-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=B000092M1T)*

	
  * [Nikon 60mm F/2.8G AF-S Micro-Nikkor](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0013A1XDY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=jenraa-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=B0013A1XDY)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=&l=as2&o=2&a=B0013A1XDY)*

	
  * Nikkor 50mm AF F/1.8D *

	
  * Micro-Nikkor 105mm F/2.8D

	
  * Nikkor 80-200mm F/2.8D *

	
  * Nikkor 28mm F/2.8 AI-s *

	
  * Nikkor 85mm F/2 AI *




## Flashguns





	
  * Nikon SB-800 - extremely versatile flash for Nikon users. I really like the built in optical trigger and iTTL remote control!

	
  * [Nikon SB-900](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B001BTG3OQ/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=jenraa-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=B001BTG3OQ)* - much bigger than the SB-800 but also easier to use and longer zoom range. My current 'go-to' flash

	
  * Nikon SB-700 - this would be the ideal first flash for a Nikon DSLR user

	
  * Nikon SB-400 - very simple, but usable especially on an extension cord (SC-29) or PocketWizard TTL

	
  * Nikon SB-26 * - older model from 1990s, but has optical trigger and is very well built (easier to put on light stands than the newer models with a different locking system)

	
  * Sunpak Auto 30 DX* - 1980s flash guns which can be acquired second hand. Very easy to manually set and cheap to replace




## Accessories





	
  * Giotto's tripods * - great value sturdy equipment

	
  * Manfrotto super clamp * - very useful for attaching cameras/lights to doors/tables etc.

	
  * Manfrotto nano stand * - nice compact flash stand. Not too sturdy

	
  * Westcott Collapsible Umbrella * - very compact umbrella

	
  * Lowepro bags * - generally very affordable and good quality

	
  * Sandisk memory cards * - these have never failed me

	
  * Lexar memory cards * - I only have 1 so far, but it is a good value card
