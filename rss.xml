&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôll kick this week‚Äôs picks off with a favourite restaurant.
I think I first went to Mildreds 5 years ago this week, when I was in London for QCon last time.
I‚Äôve since been back a number of times, most recently this week. My pictures of the food don‚Äôt really do it justice, so I won‚Äôt add them here - you can see their own ones on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/mildredsrestaurants/?hl=en&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt;.
Every time I‚Äôve eaten there I‚Äôve been extremely impressed, and I‚Äôm not surprised they have a long waiting time in the evenings.
I was surprised how little on the menu was non-vegan - it was limited to Halloumi, optional cheese on burgers, and dairy milk in coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Highlights for me were the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/B2gzRJhFoae/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;chick‚Äôn kebab with a preserved lemon marinade&lt;/a&gt;, and the chocolate cherry lava cake (the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/B2wHJP7FM17/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;picture here&lt;/a&gt; is a slightly different recipe, but similar theme with the coconut cream and cherry).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started following Paul Mason a while ago. He‚Äôs gone from being a public service broadcaster economics journalist to being a quite a partisan Labour supporter, but with lots of interesting ideas. I need to get back to reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/PostCapitalism-Guide-Future-Paul-Mason/dp/1846147387&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Postcapitalism&lt;/a&gt;‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week we had a new budget in the UK, the first since 2018.
Lots of the press was lavishing praise on the govenment for spending some money, turning its back on austerity.
Mason takes a more nuanced approach, talking about how this budget relates to Labour‚Äôs policies such as the National Investment Bank and plans to invest in social housing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;... there‚Äôs a growing consensus that by slashing interest rates and printing money, central banks are contributing to the low-growth environment that Britain and other major countries are trapped in...
&lt;p&gt;We need a whole new economic model ‚Äì and there is no way we can get one unless Treasury and central bank economists cut the crap they have been talking for more than a decade. Mainstream economics is opposed to borrowing to invest in skills, or to boost public health outcomes, because these are not classed as ‚Äúinvestments‚Äù.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs worth a read. There‚Äôs a lot going on in the financial world right now, and it feels like we‚Äôre at a tipping point of sorts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week I mentioned being at the QCon conference. This morning I had an email saying that 2 attendees had tested positive for Covid-19, and now I‚Äôm going to be working from home for the next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There‚Äôs a lot of hysteria about the virus at the moment. My local Aldi has got very low stock of a lot of products (all toilet paper and kitchen roll is gone, many fresh vegetables, minced beef, tinned veg, bread, and eggs are running low).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This podcast was recommended by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ricburton&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;@ricburton&lt;/a&gt; and it is an interview with Amesh Adalja from Johns Hopkins.
It‚Äôs a good overview of this pandemic and how it compares with previous viral outbreaks.
I do feel somewhat reassured about it having listened to this, although it sounds like the health systems around the world aren‚Äôt that prepared to deal with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of people dismiss Paul Graham, but one thing he does well is writing essays.
This meta-essay covers a recipe of sorts for writing.
Importance, novelty, correctness and strength.
I hope at some stage to get back to writing longer posts, and I‚Äôll bear in mind this advice if I feel like venting my opinions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I seem to be a sucker for jazz trios with piano, bass and drums.
Ever since I saw Esbj√∂rn Svensson Trio live, I‚Äôve looked for other groups with a similar dynamism.
Gogo Penguin do reference EST on their first album with the track ‚ÄúSeven Sons of Bjorn‚Äù, but they never quite live up to the Swedish group.
That said, I do enjoy some of their music, and their latest track is &lt;a href=&quot;https://gogopenguin.lnk.to/GogoPenguin&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;worth a listen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here‚Äôs a couple of other good tracks that I picked out:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About a year ago I was very keen on this blog post and the accompanying talk and shared it with anyone who would listen.
It charts the history of various creative disciplines and how they evolved when groups of people informally met to learn from each other. The article draws on historical examples in music, art and then moves on to software development practices.
The latter case is quite interesting - a group of people working at ThoughtWorks produced several ideas and practices which have spread through the industry. For example, Continuous Delivery, BDD testing and DevOps were strongly influenced by this group.
The post proceeds to discuss systems thinking and then the interactions between groups of people and software they are developing. It‚Äôs a refreshing change from most blog posts about technology, and while it‚Äôs long it really resonated with me. The video version of the post is also worth a watch if you like that format.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every once in a while I‚Äôm lucky enough to attend a tech conference. This week I returned to QCon in London, having last attended 5 years ago when I had just joined the BBC. It‚Äôs quite a big event, with 6 main tracks plus 2 extra ‚Äúsponsored tracks‚Äù.
The topics range from architecture to engineering leadership to more deep technical topics.

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm trying to keep up with what‚Äôs currently happening in UK politics, and there‚Äôs been quite a lot of hysteria around Dominic Cummings, the architect of the Vote Leave campaign and the main advisor to Boris Johnson.
This long article profiles a few of the other people in number 10, and it‚Äôs quite good to get the insight into who is working there.
This post details many of the advisers who came from Johnson‚Äôs time as Mayor, such as Eddie Lister (who seems to be partly behind a lot of the un-affordable housing in London) and Andrew Gilligan (who helped deliver the cycle superhighways in London, which I‚Äôm a big fan of).
We‚Äôre in for an interesting year as the government has a bigger majority than others in recent history, and the Conservatives didn‚Äôt produce a particularly detailed manifesto. It‚Äôs worth reading this to get an idea of who will be advising and implementing the whims of the Prime Minister.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favourite listen this week is another BBC pick.
This programme covers the first decade of the century, focusing on political trust in the UK.
This was the period that gave us the Iraq war, the MP expenses scandal and the financial crisis with the bailing out of banks.
It‚Äôs a good episode, with recent interviews and a lot of archive material.
I was a teenager for most of this decade, and politics wasn‚Äôt my main interest at the time, so this was a good opportunity to get a better understanding of what was going on. I do remember most of these events and I think it‚Äôs worth re-examining recent history to give a sense of perspective. Were things that much better 10 years ago? I‚Äôm not so sure, but it felt like we had the grown-ups in charge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of Norwich‚Äôs successful indie food businesses is Strangers Coffee (I‚Äôm sure there should be an apostrophe in the name, but they ommit it so I will too).
Named after the &lt;a href=&quot;https://norfolkrecordofficeblog.org/2016/06/24/strangers-a-brief-history-of-norwichs-incomers/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Strangers&lt;/a&gt;, a group of refugees from the Low Countries who settled in Norwich around 500 years ago, this coffee shop sits in the lanes and has been a fixture of my regular trips home to the city.
I was very impressed with the coffee when I first tried it, and the highlight has always been the split shot, where you get both a small espresso and a milky coffee to try the beans in two different styles.
They expanded a few years ago to have their own roastery round the corner from the coffee shop, and this past year they have opened a further two caf√©s in the city. It probably helped that it‚Äôs also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/nov/01/on-my-radar-derren-brown-about-time-bill-nighy-summer-heights-high&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Derren Brown‚Äôs favourite coffee shop&lt;/a&gt;.
I often buy a bag of their beans to grind at home. The Ethiopian Rocko Mountain is great, as is the Guatemalan coffee.
If you‚Äôre in Norwich definitely visit, but I‚Äôve also seen their beans as a guest in Manchester‚Äôs &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.idlehandscoffee.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Idle Hands&lt;/a&gt; on occasion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Five things - 27/02/2020]]></title><description><![CDATA[Wherein I discuss a TV miniseries, a podcast, this site, what makes good managers and another Aldi pick.]]></description><link>https://jens.raaby.co.uk/journal/2020/02/five-things-2</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://jens.raaby.co.uk/journal/2020/02/five-things-2</guid><pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2020 20:42:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-americast&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#1-americast&quot; aria-label=&quot;1 americast permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;1. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p07h19zz/episodes/downloads&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Americast&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a sibling podcast to what was Brexitcast - essentially a slightly irreverent discussion of a news topic with a few of the BBC‚Äôs top correspondents.
This year is the next US Presidential Election, and as I‚Äôm not usually following the pulse of US politics it‚Äôs been informing, educating and entertaining me. This has been an interesting podcast to listen to over the past few weeks, drawing comparisons between Corbyn and Sanders, discussing the electoral system in the Democratic Party (explaining things like caucuses to primaries to Super Tuesday), discussing impeachment and Bloomberg etc.. Worth a listen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs not often that a TV series grabs me like this one. It‚Äôs made me look on the map for the nearest nuclear power station and consider how lucky we are that nuclear disasters are so rare. I can‚Äôt imagine how it felt in the 1980s when the threat of Cold War lingered. This miniseries is definitely worth a watch if you haven‚Äôt seen it yet. The cast is great, and the pacing is just about right. I‚Äôm glad they kept it to 5 episodes instead of spinning it out to 10.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you‚Äôre reading this then it‚Äôs because I managed to migrate this site over to GatsbyJS. I‚Äôve moved from WordPress to Octopress to Jekyll and now GatsbyJS. It‚Äôs the perennial yak shave. Luckily there wasn‚Äôt much work to move the posts over.
I do think Gatsby is a bit of overkill for a simple site like this, but I quite liked the template and it looks simple to extend. I‚Äôve worked with the React library a fair amount now, so I‚Äôm comfortable with how the framework composes things together.
GraphQL is used to pull in data from various sources (primarily the markdown files that I write the posts in) and everything seems to work fine. We‚Äôll see how well it handles bit rot - I don‚Äôt tend to upgrade things that often and given the speed of evolution in the Node ecosystem I‚Äôm a little concerned I won‚Äôt be able to build the site in a year or two without a bit of work to upgrade things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I admit to often being in awe of Google and its practices. Especially the scale of their engineering and the strict practices they follow (using a &lt;a href=&quot;https://research.google/pubs/pub45424/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;mono-repo&lt;/a&gt; is a prime example). This article discusses some research they did into what makes good managers. Most of the points seem fairly obvious, like being a good coach and showing concern for success and well-being. I think it‚Äôs a handy list though, and one that broadly aligns with my experiences of managers.

I‚Äôve been trying to cut down on eating carbohydrates recently and that means finding foods that provide more of the other macronutrients.
Greek yogurt is quite popular for its high protein content, but the most popular brand (Fage Total) has a reduced level of fat (5%). It still tastes great, but it‚Äôs expensive. This alternative from Aldi is more like the yogurt I had in Greece - high in fat (and protein) and with a rich creamy taste.
I have it with fresh berries (raspberries and blackberries are good low sugar choices), sometimes adding milled linseed. It‚Äôs also handy for cooking (soups, curries etc.).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Five things - 20/02/2020]]></title><description><![CDATA[A return to blogging.]]></description><link>https://jens.raaby.co.uk/journal/2020/02/five-things</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://jens.raaby.co.uk/journal/2020/02/five-things</guid><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2020 22:33:25 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve wanted to get back in to blogging for a while; partly to brush up on my writing skills and partly to get some sort of recent online presence again.

&lt;p&gt;This year, for the first time, I‚Äôve managed to see all the nominees for Best Picture at the Oscars.
Parasite was definitely up there with the best; I also really enjoyed 1917. My least favourite was Joker, which I just couldn‚Äôt get behind. Parasite was a great combination of comedy and tragedy.

Anyone who has visited me in Manchester will have been dragged to Pollen at some point.
It‚Äôs my favourite bakery, making everything with sourdough (yes, even the pastry). It sates my desire for Danish pastry (or wienerbr√∏d as it is known in Denmark) and they even sell Danish style rye bread.
I‚Äôve scaled back my home baking recently, but it‚Äôs always a treat to head to Pollen for some brunch and have a chat with them about different flours and styles of bread. (I do miss the time when they were based in a railway arch and I would regularly queue for half an hour on Saturday morning to get the elusive Cruffin).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a while I kept acquiring dead-tree programming books, many of which I only gave a cursory read.
I eventually joined O‚ÄôReilly Safari on one of their big discounts. I heard later (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/martinkl/status/1083324384947945474?lang=en&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;via Martin Kleppman&lt;/a&gt;) that if you join the Association of Computing Machinery, you also have access to Safari.
I‚Äôve been a member ever since, and while I still don‚Äôt have the patience to read many books cover to cover, it feels like the best tech library I could wish for.
ACM Membership is $100, quite a discount over Safari. &lt;/p&gt;

I don‚Äôt want these posts to become an ad for Aldi, but I think it‚Äôs worth pointing out a good product when I find one.
This week‚Äôs is their organic unfiltered cider vinegar. I‚Äôve started making a drink with a teaspoon of this, a teaspoon of lemon juice and cold water. It‚Äôs a refreshing way to start the day, and apparently has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/6-proven-health-benefits-of-apple-cider-vinegar#section4&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;many health benefits&lt;/a&gt; too.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Welcome to the real world]]></title><description><![CDATA[Keeping a blog up to date is hard!]]></description><link>https://jens.raaby.co.uk/journal/2016/02/2016-02-10-welcome-to-the-real-world/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://jens.raaby.co.uk/journal/2016/02/2016-02-10-welcome-to-the-real-world/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 10 Feb 2016 20:33:25 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;It turns out that keeping a blog reasonably up to date is hard. Yep, I‚Äôve fallen into my own &lt;a href=&quot;/journal/2010/12/the-trap-of-the-blog/&quot;&gt;trap&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After most weekdays, I typically want to put my feet up and keep away from the keyboard.
However, there is clearly some value in keeping up a writing habit.
All skills atrophy without use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm hoping to distil some of my thoughts and experiences in to this blog again this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;irl&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#irl&quot; aria-label=&quot;irl permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;IRL&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past year-and-a-bit, I‚Äôve been based in Manchester. It‚Äôs one of the largest cities in the UK, probably about the same size as Copenhagen, where I spent most of 2012 up to early 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I came here to work for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt;, the national broadcaster.
I joined a department in the process of moving from London to Manchester. That meant my team inherited around 8 software systems (varying quite considerably in size).
We spent the first half of 2015 taking over from the previous team and recruiting new people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then we‚Äôve mostly worked on replacing a legacy system (last updated in 2003!). All of this has been a great learning experience; both in terms of day-to-day software development and all the things that go around that (people, communication in a large distributed company, new requirements hitting us from different directions‚Ä¶).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We chose to use the Scala programming language (also used in a few of our inherited projects). That‚Äôs been an interesting experience, after my university years involving the odd bit of Haskell, Erlang and lots of Matlab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm hoping to draw out some topics of interest and write about them here, so keep an eye out.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[A very quick update]]></title><link>https://jens.raaby.co.uk/journal/2013/02/2013-02-27-a-very-quick-update/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://jens.raaby.co.uk/journal/2013/02/2013-02-27-a-very-quick-update/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 27 Feb 2013 15:07:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve just migrated this site from Wordpress to Octopress - a static site generator.

&lt;p&gt;If you never seen or used a command line interface, it looks like some kind of ugly window into a part of your computer that really isn‚Äôt that appealing. Admittedly the ‚Äúterminal‚Äù or ‚Äúcommand prompt‚Äù is a remnant of the era¬†when communicating with a computer involved typing on a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleprinter&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;teleprinter&lt;/a&gt;. Notwithstanding the arcane history of this breed of human-computer-interaction, the command line interface available on almost every personal computer (even smartphones over a network connection) yields great power to the user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might wonder what one would use this sort of interface for in [insert current year here]. You can‚Äôt use it for viewing a full webpage with images and video; the mouse is suddenly less useful than one would expect; and there is absolutely no onscreen help or indication of what to do next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you know at least what is possible, then the command line is your potential army of slaves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here‚Äôs a small example. I had a problem after upgrading the gallery application I use, which meant that a lot of identical files were missing from a folder on the web server. The boring, time-wasting approach would be to manually copy the missing file to each of the subfolders (there were 42 of them) with lots of RSI-inducing copy-and-paste actions. The alternative, more fun and automatic way to do this is to use a command line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can approach this sort of problem with the tools which the operating system provides. ¬†Practically all you need to know is covered by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://learncodethehardway.org/cli/book/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Command Line Crashcourse&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my example problem, I didn‚Äôt know the exact¬†permutation of commands for achieving my desired result. Enter the programmers‚Äô swiss-army-knife - the scripting language. Pretty much every programmer or computer geek will know at least one of these languages, most commonly Ruby, Python or Perl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main problem to solve is getting a list of all the folders which need to contain the file which is missing. My scripting language of choice has a nice function Dir.glob() which will find any file/folder path matching some pattern. In my case, I just wanted every folder (not file) under the current one. This is fairly simple to achieve in Ruby: Dir.glob(‚Äù**/‚Äù). To the uninitiated, this will look rather meaningless. What is ‚Äòglob‚Äô? What do all those asterisks do? Fortunately, the internet makes it easy to lookup such things. Once you know a few building blocks of the language, and where to look and what to search for, it takes a couple of minutes of searching to find out that my entire problem can be solved with one line of code.
After launching Ruby on the command line (in the folder that I want to deal with):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dir.glob(‚Äù**/‚Äú).each { |subdir| &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;cp .htaccess #{subdir}&lt;/code&gt; }&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was certainly a lot shorter than changing folder and typing Cmd-V 42 times. The command takes all the subdirectories, then for each ‚Äòsubdir‚Äô calls the system copy utility ‚Äòcp‚Äô with that directory as a target for my file ‚Äò.htaccess‚Äô. I am not expecting that command to look appealing to the average computer user, but it is not beyond any computer user‚Äôs ability to learn simple tricks like this. If you have a lot of this sort of tedium to deal with on a weekly basis then I would certainly recommend looking into learning how to use the command line and maybe a scripting language.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[iPad Art]]></title><description><![CDATA[Some sketches from the iPad]]></description><link>https://jens.raaby.co.uk/journal/2012/05/ipad-art</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://jens.raaby.co.uk/journal/2012/05/ipad-art</guid><pubDate>Wed, 16 May 2012 13:30:56 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I never got round to posting these sketches I made last year when I first got my iPad.

&lt;p&gt;Here‚Äôs the rough list of ingredients I often use:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;olive oil&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;500g beef mince (or better: mixed veal and pork mince)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 tins plum tomatoes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 onion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 cloves garlic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the zest of half a lemon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a splash of Worcestershire sauce&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;salt and pepper&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;oregano&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making a sauce with these ingredients is fairly straightforward. I am also partial to Antonio Carluccio‚Äôs recipe &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.antonio-carluccio.com/Tagliatelle_al_Ragu_Bolognese&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;‚ÄúTagliatelle al Ragu Bolognese‚Äù&lt;/a&gt;¬†which creates a really nice subtle medley of flavours. If you try adding lemon zest to that it‚Äôs also very nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love the power of small changes like this. It applies equally to software. Stop and think when your app/website is frustrating you. How can you make it just a little better?&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The portable machine quandary]]></title><description><![CDATA[Is the iPad enough?

I considered the benefits and drawbacks of replacing my ageing laptop with a lithe keyboard-less tablet with a clear focus on media consumption and entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being an over-thinker when it comes to making any decision regarding spending money, I considered what Apple might change to improve the iPad further. My conclusion was that the only obvious (hardware) improvement would be adding a Retina screen and improving connectivity with peripherals. I was right about the Retina screen - to the layman, it is the only &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; upgrade of this year‚Äôs model - but we are still waiting for a change in physical connectivity. I suspect that with¬†Bluetooth 4.0, currently sweeping across Apple hardware, it may be considered the preferred interface for 3rd party devices. I still use my Camera Connection Kit to import photographs but it is a clunky workflow and I much prefer the idea of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eye.fi/products/iphone&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;using an Eye-Fi memory card&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I watched with interest as Apple unveiled the new iPad a few weeks ago. Ever since investigating the &lt;a href=&quot;http://jens.raaby.co.uk/journal/2011/04/art-on-the-ipad/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;artistic potential of the iPad&lt;/a&gt;, my mother has been interested in having her own. My plan, therefore, has been to upgrade and let her take over my old iPad. This fits nicely with my plans for travelling home after Easter as the price is approximately 8% lower in the UK than in Denmark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago, disaster struck (well, &lt;em&gt;relatively&lt;/em&gt; speaking). I accidentally dropped the bag containing both my laptop and iPad. You will probably not be surprised to learn that the iPad emerged unscathed, but the 5 and half year old laptop now refuses to boot with a screen that no longer functions. You may be wondering why this is a disaster, since I get so much out of my iPad and really don‚Äôt care for Windows laptops any longer. This is really for another post, so I won‚Äôt elaborate now, but essentially being a computer science student at a department which has no student computers (other than a small handful of thin clients) means a laptop is pretty vital to getting assignments done. Thus far these have all required use of Matlab, a rather heavy toolkit. Despite trying to remotely connect and control a computer through the iPad, it is simply no substitute for a laptop. I lasted 2 stressful weeks before borrowing an old Windows 7 laptop which I will use until the exam assignment has been handed in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back, the decision not to buy a laptop was a rational choice. I was tired of using a laptop as a desktop, and I foresaw always having a computer where I needed one. When you work in an office, they provide a computer; when you study computer science, the department has hundreds of student machines with everything you need. Why carry a heavy laptop around?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have had the misfortune to embark on my studies in Copenhagen a short while after the last room of student computers was decommissioned. Luckily I decided to bring my old laptop with me; it was a close call and I only brought it because I hadn‚Äôt had a chance to clear out the hard disk yet. So what is the way forward with my portable computing needs? I realise I must have a laptop in order to study here, and therefore I am resigned to buying one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having gradually converted to the Apple product line, I &lt;strong&gt;cannot&lt;/strong&gt; envision buying another brand of laptop. Using a trackpad on anything but a Macbook is a torturous experience. This is a slight problem when one is a cash-strapped student in one of the most expensive cities in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan is to buy a used Macbook, preferably a 13‚Äù Macbook Pro, which will be paid for in part by my mother. It will then become her main computer when I buy a new laptop later in the year. Why am I even considering buying 2 within a year? Because I am stubbornly waiting for the next wave of Apple laptops with Intel‚Äôs Ivy Bridge processors (which should increase battery life), and with Apple‚Äôs new Mountain Lion operating system which is likely to d√©but in July. The qualities I desire most in a laptop are long battery life (which seems to be the reserve of the Pro models) and light weight (the Air models); it makes sense to wait a little while when you know something better is coming, before dropping a significant amount on a new laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where does this leave the iPad? It is still my favourite portable device. It is my productivity tool - it allows pure focus on the task at hand and lasts days between charges. I can use it for reading textbooks, checking my calendar, listening to the radio and even calling people on Skype. And more. My hope is to learn iOS app development over the next year and the large touch screen provides an exciting playground for interaction experiments. Having tried the new iPad in person, I don‚Äôt think there is much doubt that I will buy one. The main issue of contention is which model to buy; we have 4G in Denmark but not the same standard as in the US. I already have a HSDPA+ WiFi hotspot which is a brilliant thing to have when you travel around with 3 or 4 WiFi capable devices. That settles one choice, but the question remains - how much space?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chose the 32GB model last year because I planned to store photographs on the iPad when on holiday. I now realise this is not a good workflow for me but it is a nice backup to have. If I am once again carrying around a laptop I would rather use that for storing and sorting the mass of images I take when on holiday. Yet with the new iPad‚Äôs higher resolution screen many are choosing to buy 64GB so they can fill it with 1080p video and swathes of large apps. The price increase for doubling the storage capacity is ¬£80, but if I am to carry both a laptop and iPad then I don‚Äôt think this is worth it - I would rather spend that money on a good case and some apps. This might be a decision I regret but if I am disciplined with deleting unused apps then it should not be a big problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As if Apple don‚Äôt get enough of my hard-earned cash already, I am seriously considering their iTunes Match service. I have a large collection of CDs at home in England which I have begun ripping to iTunes; I cannot fathom transporting them over the North Sea. Fully legal cloud music storage for ¬£22 a year is almost made for people in my situation. And it means you can listen to your music on the iPad without syncing it from another computer. When I inevitably get an iPhone (yes, it can only be a matter of time) this will be even more useful - I can spend less on device storage, yet have all my music wherever I am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this will leave me with less money, but with a very pleasurable, easy to configure computing environment that by and large &lt;em&gt;just works&lt;/em&gt;. My only wish is that there would be more alternatives that worked just as well.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Notes: Data, Context & Interaction]]></title><description><![CDATA[My notes from a talk given by James Coplien on DCI.]]></description><link>https://jens.raaby.co.uk/journal/2012/03/notes-data-context-interaction</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://jens.raaby.co.uk/journal/2012/03/notes-data-context-interaction</guid><pubDate>Mon, 19 Mar 2012 21:36:47 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;These are my brief notes based on a talk given by James Coplien (&lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/jcoplien&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;@jcoplien&lt;/a&gt;), at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://copenhagenrb.dk/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Copenhagen Ruby Brigade&lt;/a&gt; meet up hosted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://zendesk.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Zendesk&lt;/a&gt; on 19/03/2012.

&lt;p&gt;----------&lt;!-- more --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start&lt;/strong&gt; with Alan Kay‚Äôs vision of objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Objects are actually used mostly for code libraries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Software is a service not a product. It has a business value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listen to the tests. Code is so simple there are no obvious deficiencies. Or so complicated there are no obvious deficiencies. (Hoare)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Objects take use cases and blow them up. Algorithms are split up all over the place. Polymorphism makes it even worse. Testing comes along because you can‚Äôt understand the code anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agile techniques are horseshit when it comes to TDD. It (empirically) makes your code worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unit tests make it hard to refactor. Comment out all code so tests fail. Then rebuild. Coverage tests are stupid. Really hard (impossible) to cover all bases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Test the use cases not the classes. Classes are scaffolding. Architecture is dynamic - relationship between objects changes all the time. Programming in classes is at odds with business needs. This is what DCI is about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Ruby and its programmers‚Äô mindset, it is possible once again to do real OOP. Every language apart from Java allows this (!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstraction is evil. It removes information. Don‚Äôt use it!! To infer any meaning you must flatten hierarchy. You cannot test a class; you must test an object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DCI is trying to bring us back to OOP. Modern programming destroyed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is a class? You must flatten the hierarchy to understand it. Inheritance is a fancy way to do ‚Äùinclude‚Äù statements. Just hiding stuff which is still there. Worst thing is too much coupling between components. Don‚Äôt sweat class size; worry about use case size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to compress: worry about service we are providing, not the classes. Don‚Äôt worry about the bricks your building is made from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You CAN‚ÄôT TEST A CLASS. what happens in a program occurs between objects not within objects. Methods are simple. A good class is extremely dumb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Book ‚Äùhow buildings learn‚Äù. About making buildings last a long time. Flimsy = flexible, evolvable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is an object about? Object has state (usually), identity (uniqueness), behaviour; it represents a stakeholder mental model; wrappers destroy this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Models should capture a cognitive concept. A tool sits between the user and computer. Presents a model using a view. The controller coordinates the views. All about people and what they are doing. (Programmers are also people, but that‚Äôs another matter).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interesting stuff happens BETWEEN objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Classic OO architecture. Tools at the top. Domain models lie underneath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast evolving stuff should be easy to change. Classes are slow to evolve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Problem with objects is there is no place to put the interesting functions. ‚Äùform follows function‚Äù. Does function have form?
‚ÄòRoles‚Äô are the form of function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you call a method on an object from a class hierarchy: How do you know where the algorithm actually is?
You should wrap this in the context. The objects are dumb. Inject the role into the object, just before executing. The object learns or evolves to have the necessary behaviour and when done unloads that functionality. In Ruby these are modules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get objects to collaborate. Separate shear layers. Make money by adding new use cases. Simply load a new context. Nothing else has to change. No models need to be altered. DCI is the only real way to do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href=&quot;http://fulloo.info&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Fulloo.info&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially, moving abroad takes a bit of time ;-). I will probably get round to writing or finishing a post at some point but I don‚Äôt currently have my own fixed Internet connection. Right now I am typing this on my iPad in a library in Denmark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy new year to those who are still subscribed!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Why no smartphone?]]></title><description><![CDATA[On the choice to not get a smartphone]]></description><link>https://jens.raaby.co.uk/journal/2011/11/why-no-smartphone</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://jens.raaby.co.uk/journal/2011/11/why-no-smartphone</guid><pubDate>Mon, 28 Nov 2011 19:53:32 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I have twice &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; bought an iPhone. I have never &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; bought any other smartphone. In fact, I haven‚Äôt bought a new phone since 2006, as I explained in an earlier post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not simply a desire not to do the same as everyone else. I can definitely understand the attraction of having such a versatile portable computer, camera, music player and phone in one‚Äôs pocket at all times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My general philosophy (if it deserves such a grand title) is to carefully evaluate any non-essential purchase with a long term view. I‚Äôve gradually come to the realisation that everything is a compromise, and that is true of mobile phones as much as any technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The advantages of owning a smartphone for me are fairly obvious to anyone who sees the collection of equipment that one could replace. I will write in terms of the iPhone here because that is the product which I have spent the most time considering. When I visited York last weekend, I had a MiFi supplying fast wireless Internet for my iPod Touch and iPad. I also carried my current mobile phone, which continually frustrates me with its slow reaction times, small memory and lack of Internet, apps and so forth. Whilst I am a keen photographer, I did not bring my camera as it is simply not practical for me to carry. Having an iPhone I would be able to do away with the iPod touch, terrible phone and would not miss a camera. I would not spend so much time looking up mobile numbers on the iPod and typing them in to the sync-less phone. I would be able to share Internet with the iPad and not need the MiFi. I would gain GPS navigation and never again miss the ability to tweet or take an opportunist photo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst these advantages are attractive, do they justify the cost? It is worth considering alternative devices when cost is of importance. Unfortunately the gap in pricing between Apple‚Äôs latest model and the rival Android devices is not that great. I don‚Äôt find the larger screens necessary, if they are accompanied by an inferior software experience (hopefully someone will eventually prove to me that there are high quality equivalents to my most used iOS apps). No smartphone camera is as good as my current camera except in portability. This is the matter on which I feel most likely to be swayed in the future. Inevitably I desire to take photos when I don‚Äôt have a camera available and this frustrates me, but I would get far more enjoyment and use from a camera costing significantly less than a smart phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What annoys me about the iPhone 4S is that I would fairly swiftly run out of space and regret not spending more on a larger capacity model. Here is one point I concede to the myriad of Android and other non-iPhones with their expandable memory. This helped justify not buying the iPhone when I was teetering a few weeks ago. I could buy a perfectly good iPod Touch with 32GB storage for less than half the cost of the 32GB iPhone, and while it doesn‚Äôt do as much it does enough to satisfy my needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is my real reason for not buying any smartphone yet: I don‚Äôt want to be permanently attached to the Internet. I don‚Äôt want to be always available, ready to respond to any email, constantly up to date with news. I find life more interesting when I have my head up, observing. I get more time to think when I am not absorbed by a little touch screen. I can actually have a conversation with someone next to me, and not waste time playing a silly little game. If I want to take photographs, I can plan ahead and bring the real deal. I still have my iPod touch to play music and apps when I feel the need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This freedom from digital communication is becoming rarer, and it‚Äôs something I want to cherish. I am never more than a few hours from the web, so I don‚Äôt see the need to be 10 seconds from my inbox. When I eventually earn enough that an iPhone would cost me a relatively small amount, I will probably own one and enjoy it. But for now, a device that I cannot afford to replace and the costs of replenishing mobile Internet bandwidth every month, are not something I feel are worth the financial burden. I am about to begin a masters degree funded by my own savings, and for now I‚Äôd rather have great experiences and nice food than be able to check my email wherever I am.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[#7 - An older one]]></title><description><![CDATA[I cheated and dug out an old photo]]></description><link>https://jens.raaby.co.uk/journal/2011/11/7-an-older-one</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://jens.raaby.co.uk/journal/2011/11/7-an-older-one</guid><pubDate>Sun, 06 Nov 2011 20:20:37 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Today I took a few photos but nothing different enough to the earlier images.

&lt;p&gt;This coming week I won‚Äôt be posting every day. I will try to write something but I don‚Äôt intend to subject myself to a daily posting schedule just yet.

It doesn‚Äôt have to be something I think of as great, but the more time I put in, the more rewarding it is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to draw a ‚Äúthing‚Äù today. I tried to draw my iPod using just 2 colours, but that was a little dull. So I skimmed through the photos on my iPad and was inspired to try a mushroom and continue with Monday‚Äôs theme of smallish natural objects. This was a chance to practice using the brushes and smudge tool in my favourite drawing app, Procreate. I don‚Äôt feel it‚Äôs quite finished,  but it might be interesting to come back in the future and improve things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today it was 10pm before I got started, so I just did a quick sketch of some leaves. The burst and then fade of colour in the trees around us are my favourite autumnal subject. This 5 minute sketch will serve as a beginning; simple, quick and with a theme I can develop later.&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/20111031-222814.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;20111031-222814.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[One year on]]></title><description><![CDATA[An update on this blogging thing.]]></description><link>https://jens.raaby.co.uk/journal/2011/10/one-year-on</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://jens.raaby.co.uk/journal/2011/10/one-year-on</guid><pubDate>Mon, 10 Oct 2011 20:23:12 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Here I am, a little over one year since I started writing journal posts every two weeks (or so). Recently my tempo has dwindled thanks to working full-time. That doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm going to stop, just that with only so many hours available each day I can‚Äôt always do everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the moment I am living in Cambridge for 5 nights a week. I commute by bike, which takes about an hour each way including a shower and getting changed at the work end. When I get back after working I brew a mug of tea and spend a bit of time cooking and washing up. Once or twice a week my evening commute is diverted via a shop to stock up. By the time I sit down at the computer (my old laptop - not a fun machine to work on) it‚Äôs often 20.30 and I spend the a while surfing the web. Afterwards I am pretty much exhausted for the day and all I want to do is watch a TV episode or go to bed with a book. And so the cycle goes on‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs nice to be working again, but I forgot how much your free time becomes valuable. The weekends, previously a time to continue with all my hobbies and interests, have become a time to recover and basically avoid sitting behind a computer. My wrists and eyes are not fond of being parked at a desk for so many hours of the day, yet that is what I subject them to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving forward I hope to catch up with some of my draft posts. I don‚Äôt know who reads this (especially when I write too much in one go) but I shall continue and strive to come up with new things to write about and perhaps manage shorter, weekly posts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[To pastures new]]></title><description><![CDATA[On working in Cambridge and interview prep.]]></description><link>https://jens.raaby.co.uk/journal/2011/09/to-pastures-new</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://jens.raaby.co.uk/journal/2011/09/to-pastures-new</guid><pubDate>Sun, 18 Sep 2011 11:48:43 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Things have been quite busy lately; it seems impossible to relax when you have too much time on your hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow I‚Äôm starting a contract that fills the rest of the year. I‚Äôll be working near Cambridge and staying there during the week. Hopefully the early winter will not be as bad as last year as I am hoping to do most of my commuting by bike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week I‚Äôm going to be revising Java, algorithms and data structures during my free evenings. I have a day of interviews coming up at a large software company, and it‚Äôs wise to be familiar with a lot of the first year computer science material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôll be using a mobile hotspot for my internet during the week.

&lt;p&gt;While I was in Denmark earlier this month I ended up watching the morning magazine programme on the equivalent to ITV. One of the lead stories that day was on how to bake the world‚Äôs best bread. I am quite fussy when it comes to bread; one could describe me as a bread geek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year I got back in to baking my own bread. As a student living in England, buying what I consider the best bread can be both costly and time-consuming. The typical English bread bin contains a pre-sliced, very chewy (and generally white) loaf. While I can put up with this when it is toasted, or when something with a strong flavour and enough texture to hide the bread‚Äôs awful chewy-fluffy-tastelessness is applied, I generally avoid this type of bread. The wholemeal alternatives, produced in the same way, are slightly better (there is some flavour, but the texture is the same) but the only real positive side to this style of bread is the extreme longevity (i.e. it takes forever to turn stale).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is it that I look for in a bread? This is probably not a question most people take time to consider in their daily lives. The first issue to consider is the flour - wholemeal¬†or white. White is (for me) something to save for special occasions, rather than a day-to-day bread for lunch or accompanying a meal. My general bread recipe uses a blend of wholemeal and white flour which produces a good texture; I find pure wholemeal bread can be a bit too dense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next factor in bread quality is the texture. I have already explained my dislike of the sliced English bread, which primarily stems from the texture. What I look for is a spring in the loaf which is countered by a satisfying crunch in the crust. Chewy can be fine, if the bread springs back and does not stay squashed - as is the case with most sliced supermarket loaves. I am not a great fan of bread which turns to crumbs the moment a bread knife gets within a centimetre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A third quality of bread which I consider is the taste. I don‚Äôt like my standard loaves to have a very strong flavour like Rye or sourdough variants, but conversely a tasteless bread is a little disappointing. I can remember supermarket ‚ÄúFrench‚Äù bread sticks having a bit more flavour than they do nowadays, but generally the Italian style loaves have a nice flavour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might by now be wondering what the recipe I use for day-to-day bread is. I must admit, I don‚Äôt like spending large amounts of¬†time kneading. Therefore I often use a bread machine to do the mixing and then finish rising and baking in a separate tin (this gives a far better taste, crust and shape than the machine‚Äôs low temperature baking). One recipe I tried and hold in high regard is one from the Guardian by Felicity Cloake:¬†&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2010/jun/10/how-to-bake-wholemeal-bread&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2010/jun/10/how-to-bake-wholemeal-bread&lt;/a&gt;. This method requires repeated kneading for short periods, but creates a really good loaf. The standard loaf I make is similar, using sunflower oil instead of butter, and I vary between using molasses sugar and plain white sugar. I don‚Äôt normally add the vitamin C tablet, but it does create a slightly more open texture with wholemeal flour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/20110823-BestBread-6695-300x200.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Jim Lahey&amp;#x27;s bread recipe tried and tested&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I baked the ‚Äù&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sullivanstreetbakery.com/recipes&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;World‚Äôs Best Bread&lt;/a&gt;‚Äù for the first time. I say today, but the process began last night with the initial assembly of ingredients for the twelve hour resting period. This morning the dough was full of air bubbles and had grown considerably in size. The next phase of rising involved dusting the folded dough with flour and a little textural supplement (in my case poppy seeds) and placing it on a tea towel for a further hour or two. As I was slightly time constrained I limited the time to an hour, but the dough had risen substantially enough in that time and did not spring back after poking. In the mean time I took the phenolic handle off my big Le Creuset (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://jens.raaby.co.uk/journal/2011/02/cooking-with-cast-iron/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;) and preheated it to the maximum oven temperature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What came out of the oven smelled great, but then I am accustomed to that hunger-inducing scent from past baking efforts. The loaf produced a satisfying hollow noise when tapped and had a bit of give. This reassured me that the loaf would not be horribly dense. When I placed the dough in the hot pan, I did not take time to even it out in the base, and to my surprise it did not fill the width of the pan. Next time I may try to produce a perfectly round loaf, but I quite like the &lt;em&gt;rustic&lt;/em&gt; shape of this first try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The texture revealed when making the first slice was much lighter than my usual loaves. Large air pockets feature throughout, but the overall bite ‚Äògives‚Äô just the right amount. It reminds me of the texture of a good ciabatta. The crust nicely browned for the final 15 minutes in the oven and has a good crunch, better than my usual attempts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flavour is certainly good. With such a simple recipe there is not much to alter the pure wheat taste. This loaf has a really nice taste of‚Ä¶ wheat. It reminds me of how rye bread has a powerful sour scent and the flour provides the main taste. I have already mentioned that my preference is for a wholemeal/white blend but that will wait until the next time. This white loaf is slightly darker in colour than I am used to (do they bleach the supermarket loaves?) but tasted great with cheese, homemade apple chutney and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_butter&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;apple butter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would I recommend you try this recipe? It is certainly worth the effort to bake it at least once. I used a cast iron saucepan but if you don‚Äôt have one (yet) then it should work in a lidded Pyrex dish or a stainless steel oven-safe saucepan, but not necessarily as well. My main criticism is that it takes a bit of forward planning. The best timing is dependant on your work schedule. The initial preparation takes 5 minutes, but then you need to wait 12-18 hours before rising and baking. I started in the evening around 10pm and the loaf was out of the oven¬†at 12.15pm the next day, and that was hurrying things slightly. Clearly if I was working away from home during the day this would not be such a good schedule, and I would probably have to do the baking the next evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For my day to day ‚Äúsandwich‚Äù bread I will probably stick to my wholemeal/white blend with sugar and oil, but if a trial run of this recipe with wholemeal flour added works well I could end up converting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you missed it, here is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sullivanstreetbakery.com/recipes&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;link to the recipe&lt;/a&gt; once more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edit: I‚Äôve now tried the &lt;a href=&quot;http://leitesculinaria.com/21678/recipes-no-knead-whole-wheat-bread.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;wholemeal variant&lt;/a&gt;¬†which turned out really well, although I added a little brown sugar and adjusted the water/flour content. The resulting bread had a very good texture, and is definitely an improvement over my earlier 50/50 white/wholemeal attempt.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Anniversary & A Digital Deluge]]></title><description><![CDATA[It's ten years since I first had a PC and access to the Internet at home.]]></description><link>https://jens.raaby.co.uk/journal/2011/08/anniversary-a-digital-deluge</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://jens.raaby.co.uk/journal/2011/08/anniversary-a-digital-deluge</guid><pubDate>Fri, 19 Aug 2011 12:40:16 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This month it is approximately ten years since I first had a PC and the ability to use the Internet at home. It is also a year today since I ordered my iMac and iPod Touch. I don‚Äôt intend to celebrate in any particular way, but I realised that is about time I dealt with the ever-growing collection of digital data that I‚Äôve accumulated over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In ten years I have never lost any files other than on one CD which got scratched. But I have managed to get myself into a pickle with multiple backups and data¬†dispersed across far too many disks and filing systems. For the past 2 years I have wanted to get my digital ‚Äòlibrary‚Äô in order, but it is always a bit of a struggle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As primarily a Windows user for many years, I got into a routine of reinstalling my operating system and software every 6-18 months. This led me to use separate data and software partitions on my hard disk, creating a nice clean data storage system. It worked quite well when I lived at home all the time, and I used an external hard disk for backups with most important data duplicated on CD or DVD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I had more than one computer in the same house, things started to get complicated. I set up one computer as a server which allowed the other PC to synchronise user files. Easy, simple enough and reliable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2006 I acquired my laptop, which at first fitted in with my filing system quite well. However, when I moved away to university in 2007 my data became disjointed. Four years later and I haven‚Äôt managed to assimilate all my data back to a simple data store. Having a Mac for the last year hasn‚Äôt really helped with this problem, although I am gradually importing data to the large 2TB hard disk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose the problem is best characterised by the number of hard disks I have and how big they are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;80GB IDE x 2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;120GB SATA x 2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;160GB SATA&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;250GB SATA&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;320GB USB x 2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;400GB SATA&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;500GB SATA&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;640GB SATA x 2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;750GB USB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2TB SATA x 2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That adds up to over 8 terabytes of storage. 4 of those drives are primary hard disks in computers (80GB IDE, 250GB SATA, 400GB SATA, 2TB SATA) and the others are either in a desktop PC (3 of them), bare, or in USB enclosures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm sure I will manage to sort everything out somehow, but with the release of Mac OS X Lion recently I have been planning to clone my 2TB internal drive to the 2TB drive in a USB enclosure, just in case something goes wrong. This makes it really tricky to deal with all the data already on the 2TB drive, which I have started to pump out into the remaining free space on all the other drives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To top things off, I have the same situation in the physical space of my bedroom. Many years of bank statements across several accounts, school paperwork, university notes and exam papers, magazines, CDs, vinyl records, drawers full of cassette tapes clutter up the room that I spend the most time in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully I won‚Äôt end up having to buy more storage (another 2TB drive would be handy, but I don‚Äôt want more drives!) and I can force myself to clear out things I don‚Äôt need anymore. As usual however, the internet provides a wealth of distractions to stop me making progress. 10 years of distractions so far.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Summer Holiday]]></title><description><![CDATA[Getting away from the internet for a bit.]]></description><link>https://jens.raaby.co.uk/journal/2011/07/summer-holiday</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://jens.raaby.co.uk/journal/2011/07/summer-holiday</guid><pubDate>Thu, 21 Jul 2011 10:24:37 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs approaching the time of year when I take an internet holiday. I find that it really helps to get away from the constant distractions and endless flow of communications. It‚Äôs also convenient to not have to pay the internet roaming bill when you are abroad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also means that my ever growing selection of blog post drafts will either be posted shortly before I head away, or a little while after I have come back. I have a lot of hours to fill on trains the next few weeks so I hope to at least post a few things before I get away from the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of people I know find it hard to get away from the internet. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs an addiction, or if it‚Äôs just a matter of avoiding boredom. This post by Scott Adams explains part of the reason I enjoy getting away from it all:¬†&lt;a href=&quot;http://dilbert.com/blog/entry/creativity/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;What would happen if the world stopped being bored?&lt;/a&gt;¬†It‚Äôs a similar reason to why I enjoy cycling so much. When you have something gnawing on your mind, you can get away from it all and think in relative peace before you come back to the computer. The endorphins are good too.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[What does a Computer Science degree teach you in 2011?]]></title><description><![CDATA[In which I try to cover my first year of Computer Science]]></description><link>https://jens.raaby.co.uk/journal/2011/07/what-does-a-computer-science-degree-teach-you-in-2011-part-1</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://jens.raaby.co.uk/journal/2011/07/what-does-a-computer-science-degree-teach-you-in-2011-part-1</guid><pubDate>Wed, 06 Jul 2011 09:10:10 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Last Friday was the end of my university degree. I left school in 2007 and went straight to the University of York, which at the time was widely regarded as a top 5 Computer Science department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had 5 offers to choose between and while York might not have been the highest (Imperial College) or lowest (St. Andrews), it struck a good balance for me. London was a bit too expensive and Scotland too far away, and my other offers were from universities which didn‚Äôt rank as highly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought it would be useful to go through the course retrospectively to give an idea of what I have been taught and what options I had. This first post looks at the first year.&lt;!-- more --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On arrival to most Computer Science (CS) courses you are not expected to have any prior experience of the subject. Some students had taken A level Computing which is as close as it gets, but I had never been taught programming let alone had an IT lesson since the age of 11. My experience was mostly in web development which is still something I do on a freelance basis, but does not really compare to ‚Äòreal‚Äô programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The course has now been completely restructured, and some of this year‚Äôs graduates even had a different first year to me (Java is now used instead of Ada).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first term consisted of 4 introductory modules. These introduced the strands that were continued in the Spring to a more advanced level. Our first programming module (POP) was certainly a lot of fun. For those with more programming experience it was a little frustrating that they had to use a language with so little syntax other than brackets and unusual notation. Scheme (a LISP variant) still brings back fond memories to those of us who enjoyed that course, and who could forget a lecturer who launched a remote control space craft in lectures on object orientation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first maths module taught discrete mathematics and propositional logic, and this tended to polarise opinions (a lot of CS students I know openly dislike maths) but everyone enjoyed the lectures. This module was taught by an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~colin/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;excellent lecturer&lt;/a&gt;, who is deeply involved in functional programming (Haskell). It was the most challenging first-term module in terms of thought required, but definitely worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our other introductory modules centred around digital circuit design (IDD) and general computer systems background (ICS). ICS taught us the basics of the Unix/Linux command line and some simple scripting, as well as discussing computer architecture and floating point representation (IEEE754 is the only standard I can remember by number).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IDD was my first and last failure in my degree. I liked that York taught both hardware and software, but when it came to it I don‚Äôt think I am the right sort of person to work on hardware. I understood the Karnaugh maps and principles of all the logic gates but didn‚Äôt work hard enough on this module and failed it by 3.5 marks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After the first round of January exams we continued with more advanced modules on the same strands.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The programming strand continued as Algorithms and Data Structures (ADS), a course which split its time between theory (complexity, analysis, trees, maps - the things that interviewers expect you to know to a certain extent) and practice. We were exposed to a ‚ÄòMarmite‚Äô langauge - Ada. This was devised by the US DoD with type safety and lots of frustration after the freedom of Scheme. It really did teach good discipline in my opinion; with every variable and procedure being explicitly typed, with specific input and output constraints, the code you wrote (or were forced to write by the compiler, depending on how you see things) was good quality and excellent training and it‚Äôs a shame the subsequent year groups moved over to Java instead. This is the module where I spent the most time documenting code, and I wish I had kept to the style I used back then as I progressed through the course. (That‚Äôs not to say I no longer document things, but I don‚Äôt do it as thoroughly - maybe I do save lots of time not documenting the obvious things now). The ADS open assessments (coursework) involved parsing text files to data structures and performing analysis - this put into use the¬†theory component of the course. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~jeremy/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;theory lecturer&lt;/a&gt; was a particularly thorough teacher who read stories from Dijkstra and was supervised by the inventor of QuickSort, C.A.R. Hoare. It was certainly my favourite module that term, in particular compared with the hardware strand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dent in my confidence after the first hardware module was not made any better by learning analogue electronics in the summer term. This took away all the nice boolean logic and replaced it with more tenuous concepts and techniques which I ought to have paid more attention to, as this part of the exam was incredibly tough. The digital design component was better, and I managed to build my own traffic light logic, although my lab partner quit the course half way through the term. My logbook documenting the design and testing of each mini-project accounted for 20% of the marks for the module and it saved my bacon. When given the choice between hardware and software for my second year, my decision was based on my bad track record in analogue electronics and the first electronics module. This prevented me changing to the Masters version of the course later on, so in hindsight I should have carefully considered this option. (The second year hardware modules involved programming a Z80 chip and doing lots of cool things which in some cases ended up with smoke.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The computer systems strand continued with coverage of computer architectures and their history. One part of the course focussed very much on the components of a CPU needed to support basic instruction sets, in particular with a stack machine architecture. The other half of the course, with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/arch/staff/permanent/Austin&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;one of the most enthusiastic lecturers I‚Äôve ever come across&lt;/a&gt;, covered the development of computer architectures from mechanical machines to modern Intel designs. It was very enjoyable, although it was the least practical module of the summer and therefore I don‚Äôt feel I got as much out of it as some of the other courses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final strand of the first year was maths, with the ‚ÄòMathematics for Computer Science‚Äô (MCS) module. When I was at school, maths was one of my strong points. I somehow managed to impress my teachers enough to win a maths prize two years in a row, but I was not so good at the subject when under pressure in exams, despite enjoying the subject. MCS was divide in two - the first half tried to teach us A level concepts in a new way, with different notation and various pitfalls. I thought I would enjoy that part, but the other half was more interesting. We were introduced to the theory of computation in this module, moving from simple state machines up to pushdown stack automata. This was a very interesting subject for me and while challenging it has clarified what distinguishes Computer Science from Software Engineering to a certain extent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, that was year 1. It wasn‚Äôt my best year in terms of academic performance. I was tired of exams by the time I started at university; my school had them every year and A levels were quite challenging (such as¬†having 4 exams on one day, along with others the same week). My advice for younger computer science students will come in a later post once I have finished this series.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The end of the low end DSLR?]]></title><description><![CDATA[What's the sweet spot for cameras?]]></description><link>https://jens.raaby.co.uk/journal/2011/06/the-end-of-the-low-end-dslr</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://jens.raaby.co.uk/journal/2011/06/the-end-of-the-low-end-dslr</guid><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jun 2011 09:07:42 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://bythom.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Thom Hogan&lt;/a&gt;, camera commentator and Nikon expert, says that when a camera company introduces fashion to a product then the technology is no longer driving the sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve never been the type who feels compelled to upgrade to every new camera model that comes out, but the camera industry certainly wishes there were more who would.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is it that differentiates one camera from another? I my opinion, the major brands are fairly level at the moment (at least at the lower end), so consumers entering the market will decide a budget and then look at review sites or the headline (best-seller) products on camera sales websites. As an example, Nikon‚Äôs current DSLR range starts with the D3100, rising up in price and size as follows: D5100, D7000, D300s, D700, D3s, D3x. At the lower end of the scale, a consumer will probably pick a rational product for them at the time - at the moment that would be the D3100 or D5100. It is now Nikon‚Äôs job to get more money from that consumer. There are a couple of ways to do this: accessories like lenses, flashguns and camera-specific bags may be of interest to more enthusiastic consumers, but they probably bought a more expensive camera in the first place, or are savvy shoppers who buy second hand. The second honey pot for Nikon is the upgrader market: someone buys a DSLR and eventually thinks their photos aren‚Äôt good enough (they see someone else‚Äôs photos they think are better, or they don‚Äôt quite know what they are doing and blame their camera for bad images).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DSLR technology has reached a level of maturity that stops people making irrational upgrade purchases for the time being. It might be a simple matter of economics - people are saving money and therefore don‚Äôt upgrade. However, the more practical alternatives to a DSLR are becoming more competent. Who wants to carry a camera that is so big it needs its own bag? Probably not most amateurs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest high-end compact cameras, which are slightly cheaper than the most basic DSLRs, have very good image quality for general use and will fit in a pocket at a pinch. With a slightly larger budget, a compact system camera (micro 4/3, Sony NEX, Samsung et al.) costs around the same as a budget DSLR, takes photographs of a similar quality and fits in a coat pocket (at least the weight and volume are low enough to make the camera a more practical alternative to a DSLR).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why would someone buy a cheap DSLR? Canon has now decided to release multi-coloured budget DSLRs, following &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0042RTQP2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;#x26;tag=jenraa-21&amp;#x26;linkCode=as2&amp;#x26;camp=1634&amp;#x26;creative=19450&amp;#x26;creativeASIN=B0042RTQP2&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Pentax&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=&amp;#x26;l=as2&amp;#x26;o=2&amp;#x26;a=B0042RTQP2&quot;&gt;
and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B003OUX6UO/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;#x26;tag=jenraa-21&amp;#x26;linkCode=as2&amp;#x26;camp=1634&amp;#x26;creative=19450&amp;#x26;creativeASIN=B003OUX6UO&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Sony&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=&amp;#x26;l=as2&amp;#x26;o=2&amp;#x26;a=B003OUX6UO&quot;&gt; who both offer different colours on certain models. I just can‚Äôt see anyone buying these cameras. Maybe in ten years‚Äô time they will be the collectable models that make lots of money for second-hand shops. I admit this is extremely unlikely, with the pace of technology as it currently is. The only cameras that keep their value like that are the film classics (Leica, old Nikon F models and so forth).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, there has never been any desire for a budget DSLR, but that is probably because I have a set of lenses which only work with the more expensive Nikon cameras. If I had the budget that would afford the cheapest DSLRs, I would rather spend it on something pocketable. Since I am in the unfortunate position of being on the hunt for a new mobile phone, that budget would probably go towards a phone which can take pictures. These cameras are primitive, but connected to the world. With an iPhone/[insert other smartphone here] someone can take a photo and publish it on the spot. With a DSLR, the snapshot would not have seemed so attractive. What I really want is a more streamlined connected compact camera - a device with much better technical quality than a phone can offer, but with the connectivity and programmability of the current crop of phones. This is what Thom Hogan has been proposing for a while, with the camera makers just continuing along their continual refinement road which never really leads anywhere that hasn‚Äôt been visited before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What would such a device need? Software is the key here. The electronics are now well developed, and continually improving, but not enough to compel upgrades. If a company was brave enough to wed the electronics from a smart phone (the system on a chip, the 3G/Wifi connectivity) with the hardware of a DSLR (autofocus system, image processing engine, storage) and allow 3rd party developer access to enhance the functionality then they could be on to a winner. But then who would buy the more expensive models? This is the trap the companies seem to be in. It will probably take a new-comer to build such a device, to really disrupt the market and compel the giants like Canon to do something similar. But they are chasing the perpetual upgraders, the people who are now satisfied with what they have.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The inevitable phone upgrade]]></title><description><![CDATA[I have a rule which has served me well the past ten years: only buy a new mobile phone when the previous one breaks or wears out.]]></description><link>https://jens.raaby.co.uk/journal/2011/06/the-inevitable-phone-upgrade</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://jens.raaby.co.uk/journal/2011/06/the-inevitable-phone-upgrade</guid><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jun 2011 17:35:51 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I have a rule which has served me well the past ten years: only buy a new mobile phone when the previous one breaks or wears out. This has probably saved me hundreds of pounds, and I‚Äôve got used to the simplicity of a candy-bar phone which lasts for days if not weeks without needing charging. My last purchase was a Sony Ericsson K750i, back in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- more --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even then, the more advanced models featured a primitive extensibility (read: 3rd party apps), without the massive collections of free/payware apps that all the main platforms feature today. My choice at the time was reduced to a Samsung ‚Äòslider‚Äô and the Sony Ericsson, which both had cameras, music players and basic internet browsing capability. My hope was that with one device in my pocket, I would not miss my camera or walkman (I was pretty much tired of cassettes by then - I had never had an MP3 player, and CD-RWs were not that reliable). This phone was a massive leap from the previous models I had used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first mobile was a second-hand, slightly battered Sony CMD-J70. This basically did the job; I was contactable and had the ability to phone home when I was stood waiting for a bus for 2 hours. It had a couple of simple games (like throwing bananas at evil monkeys) but that was about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the Sony died, I moved on to one of the classics of the last decade - a Nokia 3310. When I began at my last school, these were all the rage. When I acquired mine 3 years after they had gone out of fashion, it was a rather bulky, though reliable, phone. It had the ‚ÄòSnake‚Äô game, and that was about all you could do. The ringtones were more basic than the old Sony (which admittedly was a more recently developed phone) but again I had something which did its job and lasted around a week between charges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The battery unit for the Nokia was the only thing which wore out. I still have the phone lying around somewhere, but it‚Äôs unlikely to ever return to my pockets. In 2006 I decided I would rather get a new phone than a new battery (which would cost almost as much), and the salesperson¬†in the shop essentially persuaded me to buy the Sony Ericsson K750i, by then superseded and probably being pushed by the retailers in order to clear out stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve been happy with this model for nearly all the time I‚Äôve owned it. The camera was not really up to much, but I made do. The music player is atrocious, but I managed to fit a 4GB memory card and fill it with plenty of music. Navigating this collection was a nightmare, but I was stubborn and refused to purchase a separate music player. This phone, while never considered a ‚Äòsmart‚Äô model, did allow installing Java applications. When mobile internet became reasonably affordable, I frequently turned to Opera‚Äôs mobile version and Google‚Äôs native email client.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alas, now my almost 5 year old device has given up the ghost. While out cycling in the Yorkshire countryside, water managed to get in to the joystick used for navigation. This part of the phone is notorious; many other K750i owners experienced the same problem, though generally they moved on to newer models several years ago. Mine waited until this year to give up, leaving me with no ability to navigate up and down lists (contacts, text messages, practically everything else on the phone).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I am left using a spare phone, a very basic Sony Ericsson J120i, which was bought with the sole purpose of housing extra sim cards when abroad. This will make do as a phone and not much else. No apps, no internet, pretty much nothing which my first mobile 9 years ago didn‚Äôt have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, that means I want a new phone. The problem with the market today is that all the devices have a shorter design life. The original iPhone was released in 2007 and had no 3rd party apps. Hardly anyone uses them now, and the successor (the 3G) is now being obsoleted with no further software upgrades. The Android phones have an even shorter lifespan; in order to keep releasing new models the manufacturers effectively neglect the older models and don‚Äôt release software upgrades. Even Microsoft had difficulty introducing the first updates to its new Windows Phone 7 operating system. The problem with WP7 is instead related to the lack of developer interest - far fewer apps exist so far. It‚Äôs not that I want quantity, but I have my doubts about jumping on this bandwagon just yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am almost tied in to the Apple eco-system, now owning an iMac, an iPad and an iPod touch and many apps for those platforms. Therefore the natural choice of phone for me would be an iPhone. The problem¬†is that the current model is approaching its 1st anniversary. Normally Apple take the opportunity to announce a new model in the Jun developers‚Äô conference (WWDC) but this year the announcements were all about software. I am hoping the next model will be released soon. It would be unthinkable for a new version to come out after Christmas, so I am hoping for at least a September release. 3 months on this old Sony Ericsson will certainly be a challenge, and I hope that an iPhone would last at as long as my old K750i. But in these days of non-replaceable batteries and rapid innovation I don‚Äôt know if I would be able to keep to my rule of not replacing a phone until it breaks. I might even have to stray into the world of contracts or buying with the intent to sell before things wear out.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[For Sale: iPod Touch 8GB, 2nd Generation]]></title><description><![CDATA[Time for an iPhone?]]></description><link>https://jens.raaby.co.uk/journal/2011/06/for-sale-ipod-touch-8gb-2nd-generation</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://jens.raaby.co.uk/journal/2011/06/for-sale-ipod-touch-8gb-2nd-generation</guid><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jun 2011 15:06:30 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I am currently saving up for a new mobile phone, which will probably be an Apple iPhone 5 in September.

However they don‚Äôt really lend a personal touch to my site in the way a custom theme would. I often store a mental image of a well designed site when I come across one (and it‚Äôs frustrating when I can‚Äôt find it again) and I don‚Äôt think my site has ever done that for anyone. It‚Äôs something I would like to achieve, but I know is quite a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post will outline a process which I hope to follow through to completion, although it‚Äôs likely to change as I go along.&lt;!-- more --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;content-first&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#content-first&quot; aria-label=&quot;content first permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Content First&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A mistake we often make in building new websites is to begin with a wire frame sketch filled with dummy text (&lt;em&gt;lorem ipsum dolor sit amet‚Ä¶&lt;/em&gt;) and this often stays in place until everything else has been completed. Increasingly designers (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.markboulton.co.uk/journal/comments/a-richer-canvas&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Mark Boulton&lt;/a&gt;,¬†Andy Clarke) are making the point that having content to design around is a far better starting point and I am inclined to agree. The problem is that in my experience, a client will want the design to be more or less done first and then will fill in the content later. The exception tends to be product photography which is fairly easy to conjure up before starting work on the site design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My approach for this website will be to think in terms of requirements and then make a list of content which fulfils these. Whose requirements, you may ask? This website is my online portfolio; I can show off my technical skills, writing ability and photography. I occasionally post something which really is not related to anything else but which gets the site a lot of traffic (in particular &lt;a href=&quot;http://jens.raaby.co.uk/journal/2011/01/microsoft-remote-desktop-on-mac-os-x/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;). My requirements therefore need to be considered in terms of a few people:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Subscribers/friends - people who want to hear what I have to say, or follow links here because they know me&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stumblers - people who end up here because there is some content that specifically interests them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Potential clients/employers - when I print business cards, they will have this URL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Myself - yep, I have requirements with regards to my website!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I have this requirements list it will be easier to produce content, or at least outline content, which will help lead to the next stage in design‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;markup&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#markup&quot; aria-label=&quot;markup permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Markup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I often start a website design in Photoshop, thinking entirely in terms of graphical design and layout. This allows lots of chopping and changing but with the multitude of potential viewing platforms available I don‚Äôt think it is the best starting point any longer. Once the content has been considered, there will be a structure to the site which needs to take precedence over visual attributes. At this point I would draw a site map, indicating how information is linked and showing how a visitor might be expected to navigate around the site. This will help produce the basic markup for a few areas of the website. I believe this is a good starting point because it is then possible to see the webpage as a search engine or screen reader sees it; the information structure and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;typography&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#typography&quot; aria-label=&quot;typography permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Typography&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My eyes hurt a lot after reading many websites. Perhaps this is a result of using a 27‚Äù screen, which in general makes things look smaller than on other devices and leads to a bit of eye strain. I think there is a certain fashion for small type on the web and I often have things enlarged a few clicks - some websites look awful when you do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the markup it is relatively straightforward to develop some simple typography rules. These can range from setting up a &lt;a href=&quot;http://24ways.org/2006/compose-to-a-vertical-rhythm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;vertical rhythm&lt;/a&gt; to simply going through the elements in the markup and setting them so they ‚Äòlook good‚Äô to the eye. I‚Äôm curious to experiment with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alistapart.com/articles/more-meaningful-typography/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;modular scale&lt;/a&gt; on this occasion, to see if it creates a better feel than guesswork or off-the-shelf font styles (such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blueprintcss.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Blueprint CSS&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/cssfonts/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Yahoo (YUI) font-reset&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;layout&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#layout&quot; aria-label=&quot;layout permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Layout&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This phase really goes hand-in-hand with typography. This is the point where bringing in Photoshop and wire-framing tools might become more important, but with so much already completed in markup itself it might be more liberating to stick to pen and paper and CSS. Designing on a pixel perfect canvas always leads to frustration when certain browsers don‚Äôt work as expected and perhaps this time I can‚Äôt get over it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My focus will be on creating something simple, without distracting elements. The focus has to be on the content; I like how some of the mini-blogging services like Tumblr and Posterous do this, and I hope to do something similarly minimalist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;style&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#style&quot; aria-label=&quot;style permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Style&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an area which I could do with practising a little more. The little details, such as drop shadows and letterpress effects which create depth on the web are something that I haven‚Äôt used much in the past. I do think that it should be left to the end, mainly so I don‚Äôt spend too long on these little details.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Design from scratch]]></title><description><![CDATA[On redesigning this site.]]></description><link>https://jens.raaby.co.uk/journal/2011/05/2011-05-14-design-from-scratch/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://jens.raaby.co.uk/journal/2011/05/2011-05-14-design-from-scratch/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 14 May 2011 20:11:08 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I will be attempting to design this site from scratch over the coming months. This will be a live development (so you get to see things as they progress).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope to blog along the way to explain some of the decisions I make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edit: Now posted the &lt;a href=&quot;http://jens.raaby.co.uk/journal/2011/05/a-web-design-process/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;rationale for the design process&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Focussed content or everything and anything?]]></title><description><![CDATA[Another meta blog post]]></description><link>https://jens.raaby.co.uk/journal/2011/05/focussed-content-or-everything-and-anything</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://jens.raaby.co.uk/journal/2011/05/focussed-content-or-everything-and-anything</guid><pubDate>Wed, 04 May 2011 07:48:34 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A lot of blogs succeed because they aim to address a niche area, and provide many high quality posts within that domain. There are a great deal of blogs which simply represent the opinions of the author in relation to current affairs. Then there are blogs like mine, where I try to follow my own interests and add in the occasional niche piece to address some technical issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a reader‚Äôs perspective, there isn‚Äôt much incentive to subscribe to my blog. If you want to know about the iPad, then there are millions of other bloggers writing about it too. Web design, photography, cycling infrastructure and all the other topics that I have discussed are all covered by more in-depth sites elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what is it I can offer that is unique? This is a question I am constantly asking myself of late, and it has stopped me posting as often as I wanted to. At the moment the people who read things here are people I know personally, but the most inbound traffic seems to go to the posts I have made regarding specific technical issues. The conclusion I can draw from that is that I should focus on technical, highly focussed content that people will seek out. Opinion is easy to find,¬†expertise is less easy to locate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the time being I will continue writing about anything that interests me, but I will try to focus more on presenting my expertise as well as opinion. If you have any thoughts about this, please feel free to get in touch or leave a comment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Art on the iPad]]></title><description><![CDATA[This is just a short post with one of my sketches done on the iPad]]></description><link>https://jens.raaby.co.uk/journal/2011/04/art-on-the-ipad</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://jens.raaby.co.uk/journal/2011/04/art-on-the-ipad</guid><pubDate>Tue, 19 Apr 2011 19:06:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This is just a short post with one of my sketches done on the iPad with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.savageinteractive.com.au/Procreate/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Procreate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

In every activity there are always the people who prefer to discuss the equipment or technology more than the actual activity itself. I‚Äôve noticed this in particular with photography and cycling, two of my main hobbies. With photography, people often get the impression that buying a better camera will mean you take better photos. What makes a photo good is not the camera that takes it, but the person who composes and takes the photograph. I always cringe when I hear something along the lines of ‚Äúyou must have a really good camera‚Äù when I‚Äôm showing someone a photo I‚Äôve taken. Of course I‚Äôm not showing you photos from a 1 mega pixel camera, but it was me who took the photo, not the camera. I‚Äôve even had some good results with my 2 mega pixel phone camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a similar vein, what matters to most users in web design is the design and usability rather than the technology that underpins them. A lot of designers out there are far more comfortable in Dreamweaver or Flash and as a result we have a lot of websites which seem outdated from a technology perspective. On the other hand, a lot of developers‚Äô sites use newer technology very well but don‚Äôt appeal aesthetically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would put myself in both the technology and design camps, but being a compsci student means I will have to talk a bit about the technology side first.&lt;!-- more --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I admit that some of my sites are still using outdated technology (but no tables for layout :)). But it‚Äôs about time I updated some of the code to make use of newer techniques. It‚Äôs quite interesting looking at some of the work I did 10 years ago and thinking about how trends have changed. Back in 2002 I started using PHP to make parts of websites dynamic, with lots of server-side includes for things like web statistics and navigation bars, but looking back it seems a little over the top to keep using those techniques. I‚Äôve recently adopted the &lt;a href=&quot;http://html5boilerplate.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;HTML5 Boilerplate&lt;/a&gt; as a basis for a lot of experimenting. It is a little ‚Äòoverkill‚Äô for a small site, but with the recent 1.0 version there is now a very handy &lt;a href=&quot;http://ant.apache.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Ant&lt;/a&gt; build script which does a few nice things to improve your output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Primarily, all your CSS and JavaScript files are combined and¬†&lt;em&gt;minified&lt;/em&gt;, reducing download size. The files are given a simple version-based naming convention, so each time you build a new file name is generated. This is particularly important if you use the server configuration files that are provided, as they change how visitors‚Äô browsers cache files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A further nicety is the HTML reset and baseline styles. This has come into fashion in the last few years, with files like &lt;a href=&quot;http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Eric Meyer‚Äôs reset&lt;/a&gt; popping up all over the place. By forcing the developer to define their own styles for every element they use, the result tends to be more platform independent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major advantage of the build script for updating an older website is the image compressor. All the files within the site are optimally compressed to save loading time and page weight. I‚Äôve significantly streamlined the &lt;a href=&quot;http://raaby.co.uk&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;raaby.co.uk landing page&lt;/a&gt; using this method. This page is based almost entirely on images and could do with a bit of a refresh, but adopting the boiler plate system has made a big improvement. Now the YSlow speed measuring tool gives an A-rating, although it wasn‚Äôt too bad before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if you don‚Äôt want to use the HTML5 boilerplate code for your site, I highly recommend trying out the build script. I will hopefully be able to improve my workflow (which is in a bit of a mess thanks to my Windows/Mac transition) using Ant to publish files to FTP and additionally integrate with my SVN/Git repositories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While updating sites that work perfectly fine may seem like overkill, it is certainly useful to practice using the latest technologies and try approaching the same designs with a more up to date perspective on how to build things. I will try to make time for updating other sites to use these new technologies over the coming months. I would like to update the design of this blog to use my own design, but there isn‚Äôt enough time for everything. Perhaps I should start looking at WordPress templating, although a couple of projects which might be a good &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sams/Thematic-html5boilerplate&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;base&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.blog.wordpress.com/2010/12/10/new-theme-toolbox/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;already&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/zencoder/html5-boilerplate-for-wordpress&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;exist&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[iPad - the first two weeks]]></title><description><![CDATA[I decided to snap up one of the refurbished iPads which Apple were selling at reduced price.]]></description><link>https://jens.raaby.co.uk/journal/2011/03/ipad-the-first-two-weeks</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://jens.raaby.co.uk/journal/2011/03/ipad-the-first-two-weeks</guid><pubDate>Tue, 29 Mar 2011 09:08:17 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I decided to snap up one of the refurbished iPads which Apple were selling at reduced price. As I now sit typing out my first impressions I can‚Äôt help but feel something has changed with technology.&lt;!-- more --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone who has seen the app that makes them smile, makes them giddy with excitement, but more importantly makes them want an iPad, will understand the appeal. When I saw the demo of GarageBand for iPad, that pretty much decided the matter. Who cares if it has no built in keyboard, if you can use it as an 8-track? Why worry about the lack of expandable storage in this day of wireless connectivity? It‚Äôs not like we are still using memory sticks to share files. I can‚Äôt even remember the last time I burned a CD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs the cloud based apps that have allowed me to use the iPad in synergy with my desktop computers. I have been using Google‚Äôs Reader for many years now, and Reeder on my iPod and now iPad gives me a much nicer, quicker way to read through things. I hope to actually get my unread count down to 0 at some point, now that I have Instapaper integration set up. It‚Äôs not completely faultless (I am sick of multiple-page articles now) but allows me to always have something to read, even when I‚Äôm away from a Wifi signal. To a lesser extent I can use Flipboard to give me something to read offline, but I haven‚Äôt quite explored that option yet. Twitter for iPad is also very elegant, and I don‚Äôt miss the equivalent Mac app at all. iTunes home sharing means I can sit here and listen to some of the many hours of music stored on a PC in a different room. This kind of technology is not especially new or unique to the iPad, but it‚Äôs certainly the first time I‚Äôve managed to do something like that without being frustrated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who haven‚Äôt tried an iPad, or who‚Äôve only tried one in a shop, really need to find someone with one and have a play. When I have shown people my photos on this thing, it gets people excited, even though that app is a bit long in the tooth (I‚Äôve heard rumours of iPhoto being ported). Then you find a game that allows multiple people to crowd round and get involved, while the iPad‚Äôs owner watches with a certain amount of bemusement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought Procreate last night. I was on the point of buying Brushes, but decided to find out what else is on offer before pressing the little green button and saying goodbye to another ¬£4.99. Luckily I found a painting app that really does impress, with its crafty use of speed to make brush stroke adjustments, the very slick layering and indeed the ability to zoom in and work on finer detail. I know that other apps have these same features, but there‚Äôs little point buying all of them. This is the first app that has got my mother excited, and which makes her want an iPad. It represents something that is actually novel; you can now walk around using a device the size of a book to create art, and then email it instantly. No mouse involved, no keyboard involved, just simple direct manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To most of those reading this (probably the 2 who have subscribed to the RSS) there is nothing really new about what have written. I‚Äôm sorry. I can‚Äôt help but get excited. I can‚Äôt wait for iPad 5 or whichever iteration allows people to get by without a desktop PC at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So where do the other tablets fit in? We‚Äôve heard how RIM‚Äôs device will emulate Android, but only the phone apps will work and not particularly well at that. Google‚Äôs tablet OS is still a bit behind, and I really can‚Äôt see why you would want to install it on an iPad, as one CS student intended to. The problem is developers want to earn a living, and they will go where the money is. Some developers care so much about free/open source that they can‚Äôt develop for the iPad (they refuse to buy a Mac). Well, they can at least build web apps which should be cross platform, but who is buying these other tablets? I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve seen one outside a shop. Besides, how long will it take someone to build a credible alternative to GarageBand or Procreate, or any of the other apps I enjoy, for another device? I don‚Äôt want to wait. I can understand if you don‚Äôt want an iPad; you probably haven‚Äôt seen an app that makes you want one yet. I can forgive the technical limitations that people often like to point out, because most people I talk to take one of 3 views: it‚Äôs too expensive, it doesn‚Äôt do x, y or z which Android can do; or it doesn‚Äôt have a keyboard so it can‚Äôt be any good. That‚Äôs fair enough, just show me an Android with the same ecosystem (apps etc.) and the same battery life and screen quality. Not an easy task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don‚Äôt want these matters to get in the way of my own enjoyment of the iPad. It‚Äôs the fist genuinely exciting device I‚Äôve owned for a long time. Now I just need to think of a missing app and make it.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The elephant in the room]]></title><description><![CDATA[This is just a¬†short follow up from this morning's post.

I didn‚Äôt really discuss online rentals or streaming content very much, because the perceived problem that the news articles I linked to focussed on was pirating content and distributing it online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While my post covered the principles which would help persuade people to legally buy films online, the elephant the title of this post refers to is online streaming. With the most recent Apple TV, storage was removed. This means that the only way to watch films using the device is by streaming from another computer or online. This restriction upset plenty of people, but perhaps it is a move in the right direction. In the US, Netflix is very popular as a way to watch films with a $7.99 subscription. In the UK, Lovefilm has started streaming films but with a cost of either ¬£2.49 or ¬£3.49 to watch a single film I believe it‚Äôs not quite the same proposition. If you have a DVD subscription then there are varying levels of online film watching included (using Flash) but a lot of the films I want to see cost extra on top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In principle I like the idea of online film streaming, it just doesn‚Äôt present the same value that buying a DVD has. ¬£2.49 for a one-watch rental, or ¬£5.99 for the DVD you can watch any number of times (OK, they aren‚Äôt that cheap when initially released). Admittedly with some films you don‚Äôt intend to watch them that many times, so the rental model is quite nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the real issue is: when can we have $7.99 subscriptions for film streaming in the UK? Once again it‚Äôs a value thing‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Principles for an online film distribution system]]></title><description><![CDATA[What would make a good digital film consumption system for the future.]]></description><link>https://jens.raaby.co.uk/journal/2011/03/principles-for-an-online-film-distribution-system</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://jens.raaby.co.uk/journal/2011/03/principles-for-an-online-film-distribution-system</guid><pubDate>Sun, 13 Mar 2011 11:04:22 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of articles today in the Observer on the topic of illegal film downloads and in particular how to ensure the revenue of the small British film industry &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2011/mar/13/illegal-downloads-threaten-british-film&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;can be protected&lt;/a&gt; in the face of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/mar/13/film-piracy-illegal-downloads-internet&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;‚Äúsomething-for-nothing‚Äù culture of the youth&lt;/a&gt;. This made me give some thought to what I think would make a good digital film consumption system for the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main problem that the industry has correctly observed is that of online piracy. There are plenty of articles online explaining why this has become so pervasive, but this post will instead discuss some principles that a commercial service ought to incorporate to make consumers happy and persuade them to part with cash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is no good introducing a new film download or streaming service that is not simple to use. By simple I mean that anyone, no matter their expertise, should be able to use it. Finding content should be incredibly simple using a single search box, but meta-data should allow simple navigation between related films. This leads on to my next issue:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For such a service to thrive, it has to avoid frustration. If someone wants to watch a specific film and it isn‚Äôt available, that is a significant problem. The more times this happens, the less likely the user is to come back. What is the point in an online film watching service where you can‚Äôt find the films you want to watch? This ties in with simplicity - users should not have to sign up to multiple services in order to watch all the content they are interested in. On the other hand there ought to be multiple services for accessing the content, to allow for competition on pricing and features. As long as each service offers enough of a distinction from the others, this is not a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any new online film service needs to be cross platform and unrestrictive from the perspective of the customers. By this I mean that films should be viewable on mobile platforms such as iOS and Android (in particular on tablets), as well as on traditional PCs running any operating system, and importantly on any set-top boxes with internet connectivity (people do still want to use their nice big TVs for watching films!). The issue that causes problems in this area is digital rights management (DRM) and this in turn persuades people to go down the illegal route.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When someone buys a film on a DVD, they feel they have some ownership of the artefact. They may not have the rights of the producers, but they have the ability to watch it on their own terms. No technology introduced by the film industry after the humble DVD seems to give people this same sense of control. Blu-ray players feature a complex DRM system that needs access to the internet to keep it up to date. Online film purchasing is often infested with DRM and even when this is not the case, there is a perception that it is. When a consumer is confident that they can buy a film online, download it and watch it at their leisure on any device of their choosing, without restriction, then one of the big incentives to download illegally will have been removed. The music industry seems to have caught on to this, with online sales now apparently growing healthily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to online rental, then DRM in some form will be necessary to stop the user playing the content after a certain period. At present the best solution to this seems to be using Adobe Flash to stream videos using a special protocol. The alternative is a file format with DRM to prevent playback after a certain period (the iTunes approach). Neither of these is particularly attractive unless the price is very low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a consumer buys a DVD or CD, they get something physical for their money. Not only can they play it at their will, but they have something tangible that won‚Äôt just self-destruct. There is also a level of confidence that the format will still be playable in the future. An issue that some people take into account is the ability to sell or give away their DVDs and CDs when they no longer want them. In short: there is some value to their purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Online purchasing does not give the same perception of value. The cost of buying an album ought to be cheaper than buying the CD, with its better audio quality and cost of manufacture. Yet it is often the case that online media costs the same or more than physical media. This is difficult to understand from a consumer‚Äôs point of view and to a certain extent it reduces trust in the provider (‚Äúare they ripping us off?‚Äù). Therefore any online film purchasing system has to be cheaper than going out and buying the same content on physical media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don‚Äôt think any service meeting all these principles will arrive imminently. It will take some time to persuade the big stakeholders that these principles would provide an incentive to stop illegally downloading. At the moment the line of enquiry taken is to look at blocking access to file sharing services and to take people to court over alleged file sharing. This has been provably counter productive and costly for the industry. If someone can build a commercial system that meets the principles outlined in this post, then we are on to something. Unfortunately capitalism tends to get in the way. But one example of a system which ought to be possible with films is that of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.valvesoftware.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Valve‚Äô&lt;/a&gt;s Steam. If a simular platform for films could be made ubiquitous (cross platform) and give convenience, simplicity, choice and value, then the future of online film sales would look promising.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Keeping track]]></title><description><![CDATA[I've been wondering if using this blog is a good way to log the films I've watched recently.]]></description><link>https://jens.raaby.co.uk/journal/2011/03/keeping-track</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://jens.raaby.co.uk/journal/2011/03/keeping-track</guid><pubDate>Wed, 09 Mar 2011 17:21:50 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve been wondering if using this blog is a good way to log the films I‚Äôve watched recently.

&lt;p&gt;Having watched the iPad 2 keynote, I don‚Äôt think this is going to deter customers that much. The apps which were demonstrated were putting emphasis on creative uses for the iPad. Over the past year we have seen a lot of passive apps: those which allow you to consume media such as books and magazines. There have also been many apps exploiting the touch screen for creative purposes such as sketching and drawing, and even word processing and DJ‚Äôing. The possibilities for this interface are absolutely amazing; just give it a little more time and I think lots of people will be able to eschew their personal laptops for these tablets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- more --&gt;It&apos;s certainly an interesting time to be in the market for a portable computer. I chose to go for an iMac last year instead of a MacBook or MacBook Pro because my main use cases for a laptop did not require the power they offer. When I used my laptop away from home it was typically for entertainment (watching videos on holiday or on the train), reading and note taking (jotting ideas down and keeping up with lecture slides), and collecting and sorting photographs (particularly when on holiday). I had been using my 15&quot; laptop essentially as a desktop from 2007 to 2010, with an external monitor, keyboard and mouse as well as¬†several external hard disks. The iMac simplifies things to the point where my desk just has the computer, the mouse and the keyboard. Admittedly, I also have an external hard disk plugged in for Time Machine backups, and my Wacom tablet sits there waiting for wrist pain to strike again (or if I&apos;m doing lots of photo editing). The stunning 27&quot; screen allows me to do everything I want, especially with multiple desktop switching (&apos;Spaces&apos;), far better than I could with my old laptop and its tiny screen. I used a 21.3&quot; 16:10 display alongside the laptop, and while this is quite a nice setup, it&apos;s not quite a match for 2560 x 1440 (basically four times the resolution of many 13&quot; laptops).
&lt;p&gt;But I digress‚Ä¶ Why would I choose an iPad over a new laptop? (The old laptop is still chugging along nicely, but is a little worse for wear and the battery doesn‚Äôt hold any charge). For my personal uses, the iPad is really cool. I could take it on holiday in a fraction of the space my laptop takes, without having to take a massive power supply and an external hard disk. When I go abroad I tend to take a camera bag with pro-grade lenses that weigh a lot; adding a 3kg laptop is not nice (and it doesn‚Äôt really fit my camera bag that well). The iPad with the camera connection kit is actually capable of doing all my remote photo storage - I am not a professional photographer taking tens of gigabytes a day, all I want is a screen to review the shots of the day and delete the bad ones, while allowing me to back them up (OK, the iPad has limited storage, but I don‚Äôt typically take enough photos to quite fill the smallest one up - I could always get more memory cards and only back up the best shots to the iPad).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of consuming media, the iPad just wins. Ten hours of battery life and a month of standby time is such a bonus over a laptop. I see so many people on trains with their laptops plugged in to power sockets; I haven‚Äôt used a laptop which can live up to the iPad in this regard. What are these people usually doing on their laptops? Watching videos, doing a bit of reading, playing solitaire, maybe writing something like an email. The iPad can do all this, and it excels at many of these tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I must admit that I have done some programming on my laptop when out and about. It‚Äôs useful to be able to take my work environment with me and then get things done while travelling. But that‚Äôs work. If I was earning money to do programming or web development then that work ought to beget a laptop. If I was a professional photographer with deadlines, then a full blown laptop would be necessary to reliably back up all my work and get some heavier post processing done before returning home. These hypothetical situations shouldn‚Äôt really come into consideration until the need arises, at which point the money for a laptop should be forthcoming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What would an iPad with a Retina display do that the current one can‚Äôt? This is the main ‚Äòmissing‚Äô feature of the iPad 2, but I can‚Äôt see how it would be a problem for most people, at least if you can put up with most other portable screens. Those I know with the iPhone/iPod Touch 4 always like to go on about how they can‚Äôt see pixels, but my sight isn‚Äôt good enough for that to matter to me. I do notice jagged font edges on my iPod Touch but it‚Äôs not something I want to worry myself about. When Retina comes to the iPad, it will make the device more pleasurable to use for many people, but it ought not to add anything to the capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An awesome new capability for the iPad would be more I/O connectivity. With the iPad 2 there will already be an HDMI output adapter, which is great for teachers or those who need to give presentations (we already have Keynote for the iPad). The camera connectivity kit is rather clunky; some people spoke of a possible SD card reader, and that would be great in terms of simplifying cables, but my camera doesn‚Äôt use SD cards so it wouldn‚Äôt help me or many others with professional cameras. Thunderbolt on the other hand would have great potential. I don‚Äôt think it would be able to work like the Thunderbolt on the new MacBook Pro; the interface on the host computer provides a PCI-Express bus and monitor connection, which are not really needed for an iPad (it has no PCI Express and now there is an external display option anyway). But if you could have a breakout box from a Thunderbolt port with more audio connections, or a proper card reader, that could really enhance the iPad for creatives in the music and photo industries. I don‚Äôt think Thunderbolt would come as an additional port; it might come as a future replacement for the dock connector, but we‚Äôll see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I am just weighing up whether I do really want to spend money on an iPad and if so which capacity would I want? 3G would be great, but it only leads to spending more money. If I had a smartphone with a personal hotspot, then that issue would practically go away. I‚Äôll see if I can make my mind up by 25th March.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edit: Apple is selling the old iPad at a greatly reduced price. That might swing my decision towards a bigger capacity old model. Then I could save my money for the Retina version.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Time to sell a bike]]></title><description><![CDATA[I have too many bikes]]></description><link>https://jens.raaby.co.uk/journal/2011/02/time-to-sell-a-bike</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://jens.raaby.co.uk/journal/2011/02/time-to-sell-a-bike</guid><pubDate>Sun, 20 Feb 2011 11:03:16 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Last year I managed to buy what has been one of my dream bike frames - a Principia. These frames were handmade in Denmark until 2004, when the factory closed. Since then, Principia bikes have been manufactured in the far east, like so many others. Fortunately when the factory closed there was still a lot of stock left, and various distributors bought it up. The frames had a reputation for good build quality and ride quality. They are ranked with the likes of Cannondale for aluminium frames, which is high praise. So when I managed to find one that I could afford, unused, from the last batch of stock, I jumped on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately I already had a road bike, and don‚Äôt really need two. So now the time has come to sell off my old one, the trusty Airborne Blackbird. I‚Äôm trying to work out how to best sell it in this age of social media. I‚Äôm starting out with a Gumtree ad, then I will try other methods. I‚Äôm not too keen on eBay as people have to commit to buying a bike they haven‚Äôt had the chance to see in person; also the people using it tend to look for better known brands and therefore the final price may not be that good for a bike which is rarer, like mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watch this space - I may put an ad on this site and link to it from elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Cooking with Cast Iron]]></title><description><![CDATA[I recently became a bit of a fan of traditional cast iron cookware.

There is something satisfying about a pan that will outlast you, especially something which is better at doing its job than many more expensive items.&lt;!-- more --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It started when I got a bit fed up with my non-stick pans losing their coating. The chemicals which are used to make the cleaning easy are potentially dangerous when they start flaking off into your food. (Of course this also makes it harder to clean them‚Ä¶) I began to think that the non-stick pan is just another manifestation of built in obsolescence - your pans will lose their coating and you will need to buy some new ones, helping the manufacturers stay in business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Amazon brought their ‚ÄúBlack Friday‚Äù week to the UK, with dozens of special limited offers with an element of competition (he who clicks the button first, gets the item), and one of the items that came up several times was cast iron casseroles (Dutch Ovens/Cocottes), I became a bit obsessed. I had wanted one of those large enamelled pans for a while and the internet gave the impression that Le Creuset was &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; brand to get. So I ended up with a 26cm round pan, which is frankly a bit bigger than I expected. However this size is pretty good for all sorts of dishes, from fitting a whole chicken inside, to making soups, stews, a bit of roasting and potentially puddings and cakes (I haven‚Äôt tried anything sweet in it yet). I also got a little bit of eBay fever and ended up with a tiny¬†Le Creuset cast iron saucepan, thinking it would be good for reheating things for myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that these are now my favourite pans. They are much easier to clean than I expected and very efficient in terms of keeping things warm. They aren‚Äôt so good for rapid temperature changes, but that‚Äôs not the point. I really like making a rice pilau in the small pan, when I can turn off the heat to let the rice steam while I get the rest of the meal ready. The large casserole gives me an excuse to make larger portions to freeze down, and gives an excuse to cook for guests (especially useful when slow cooking things - less worry about getting the timing right).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve now ended up with a third item. A few months ago I came across Skeppshult, a Swedish &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.skeppshult.se&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;bicycle manufacturer&lt;/a&gt; that also makes &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.skeppshult.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;cast iron pans&lt;/a&gt;. The cast iron Le Creusets were a slight diversion from my original plan to replace the non-stick frying pan. I still haven‚Äôt done that, but I may end up with a Skeppshult (I‚Äôd like to get one in Sweden itself as they are about half the price there). But I have recently been doing a bit of grilling with my housemate‚Äôs square grill pan, so when I found a Swedish grill pan on eBay that nobody had bid on it ended up in my hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the pan was used and needed a bit of a clean up, I took the chance to research cast iron seasoning. I had no idea how much internet debate this would dig up, but it turns out that people care a lot about something like this. I first looked at Nigel Slater‚Äôs advice in his book Appetite (great read, much more prose than most recipe books). It wasn‚Äôt that specific, but I eventually found a great article on the ‚Äô&lt;a href=&quot;http://sherylcanter.com/wordpress/2010/01/a-science-based-technique-for-seasoning-cast-iron/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;chemistry of cast iron seasoning&lt;/a&gt;‚Äô which is quite an involved article going into a lot of detail. But I am now halfway through seasoning the pan, and although the flaxseed oil is expensive, I‚Äôm not using that much of it for this purpose. If I can put up with the taste I might try it on salads‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point I will need my own kitchen in which to use these pans; they aren‚Äôt particularly small or lightweight :).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Microsoft Remote Desktop Client on Mac OS X: "Cannot verify the identity of the computer that you want to connect to"]]></title><description><![CDATA[Once again a little bit of tech support to fill a gap in the Google results...]]></description><link>https://jens.raaby.co.uk/journal/2011/01/microsoft-remote-desktop-on-mac-os-x</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://jens.raaby.co.uk/journal/2011/01/microsoft-remote-desktop-on-mac-os-x</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jan 2011 15:18:07 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Once again a little bit of tech support to fill a gap in the Google results‚Ä¶ This time I am publishing a quick solution for an error with Microsoft‚Äôs Remote Desktop Connection client for OS X.

&lt;p&gt;The description is not that helpful, especially when you know that the target machine is accessible from the Mac: ‚ÄúRemote Desktop Connection cannot verify the identity of the computer that you want to connect to.‚Äù My first thought was to check that I could ping the Windows PC and verify that the Mac could communicate over the network. This succeeded, which left me scratching my head. I then tried changing the settings for accepting remote desktop connections on the PC itself, so that it would accept lower security connections (not really something you would want to do if the port is open to the internet.)¬†This did not solve it either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normally when connecting to a Windows machine over the network, you must supply a login domain. In the case of a standalone PC, this will be the host name, often ‚Äúyourname-pc‚Äù if you used the suggestion Microsoft offers. The Mac RDP client puts this in for you by default. In the example shown above, I had entered ‚Äúlaptop‚Äù and told the client to connect - this was the next dialogue shown. I entered my username and password and clicked ‚ÄòOK‚Äô. That is when the error (eventually) popped up. I finally deduced that this seemingly unrelated error message could in fact be traced to the ‚ÄúDomain‚Äù field. Using the host name would be correct in this situation, however for some reason the only way I could actually connect was to &lt;strong&gt;clear the field completely&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to deal with snow]]></title><description><![CDATA[How do Denmark and the UK deal with snow?]]></description><link>https://jens.raaby.co.uk/journal/2011/01/how-to-deal-with-snow</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://jens.raaby.co.uk/journal/2011/01/how-to-deal-with-snow</guid><pubDate>Thu, 13 Jan 2011 11:43:01 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jens.raaby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/20101223-WinterSnow-8941.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://jens.raaby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/20101223-WinterSnow-8941.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Snow Tractor&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the Christmas holiday I spent a week in Denmark, where the arctic chill that affected England from the end of November also took hold. For Denmark the temperatures were not &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; unprecedented; within the last 50 years the sea has frozen across the √òresund belt to Sweden several times. For some photos showing the kind of conditions that I am referring to, one of the Danish newspapers has a gallery entitled &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bt.dk/nyheder/dengang-det-var-rigtig-isvinter-i-danmark&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;‚ÄúDengang det var rigtig isvinter i Danmark‚Äù [When there were real ice winters in Denmark]&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are certain things you notice more than others when it snows in the UK. Mainly that, if you aren‚Äôt a car owner, nobody really does anything for you. Additionally, if you live somewhere that actually requires you to have a car (like in a remote village), you don‚Äôt get the same level of snow-clearance service as the towns and cities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To a certain extent, this shows how councils are pragmatic: they do the most snow clearing where the majority live. When the budget for grit starts to run out, only the main roads and bus routes are dealt with. But where does that leave the small streets, and people without cars (this includes a lot of those I know in York)? Essentially, the council doesn‚Äôt do anything for you; some decide to put salt down on a path alongside their home. This is fine and dandy when you walk past these homes. It really is useless when you compare it with the situation in Denmark and other continental countries more adept at handling the conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jens.raaby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/20101223-WinterSnow-8955.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://jens.raaby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/20101223-WinterSnow-8955.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Note how the piles of snow are on the road, not on the cycle lane or pavement!&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jens.raaby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/20101224-DKJul-8990.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://jens.raaby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/20101224-DKJul-8990.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Efficient clearing of footpaths by council&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;One thing I give high priority is pavements. It is your civic duty to clear them in Denmark - if the pavement outside your property is not clear, you could get into trouble. In Britain last January, the ‚ÄúInstitution of Occupational Safety and Health‚Äù gave advice to business owners that clearing your pavement could make you liable to be sued if someone has an accident after you have done the clearing. This ludicrous recommendation was spread by the media and ordinary people became reluctant to clear the footpaths by private property. See this &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8443745.stm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;BBC article from last year&lt;/a&gt; for a small overview of civic duty snow clearing).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government has good, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Nl1/Newsroom/DG_191868&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;clear advice&lt;/a&gt; - you will not be sued if you do a good job (the media is more effective at drilling in its scaremongering though - my neighbours last year refused my help clearing their snow). The article also suggests helping elderly people with their paths. In Denmark this neighbourly attitude doesn‚Äôt always seem to hold - my 90 year old grandmother won‚Äôt leave the house while there is snow outside, and certainly can‚Äôt clear it; the neighbours didn‚Äôt seem to offer any help with clearing the snow when I was there, and the council-employed ‚Äúhome helpers‚Äù didn‚Äôt seem to be bothered either. But when all the pavements are cleared, you can actually get out and walk! In York the cold spell meant that I didn‚Äôt want to risk cycling; the roads were narrowed as a result of snow ploughing spoils and I daren‚Äôt trust car drivers in these conditions. I was reduced to walking in and out of town, which normally takes in the region of half an hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The snow covered pavements were a nightmare. If nobody was walking on them then it would be fine - I could make my way through and merely get wet feet as it melted through my shoes and socks. But when everyone decides to walk, the snow becomes compacted, then freezes into ice. In some places it wears down and the result is little pockets where you can see pavement. My half hour walk into town was elongated into almost an hour and I ended up with aching ankles for the next 2 weeks because of walking so much on the uneven surfaces. Don‚Äôt forget what happens when the temperature oscillates around freezing point‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why I get so excited about the little snow clearing machines, designed to fit on pavements and cycle lanes, which run up and down Copenhagen‚Äôs streets multiple times an hour when it is snowing. They brush off the snow before it has much chance to stick, and when it does, they go over several times with an effective plough-brush technique. During the rest of the year, these machines don‚Äôt just sit there doing nothing (like the big gritter lorries and ploughs you see in the UK) but have other ‚Äúaccessories‚Äù for other council jobs, like litter clearing, pavement sweeping etc. You even see lawnmowing tractors with snow clearing attachments, and I‚Äôm pretty sure most councils in Britain could procure those. See Copenhagenize‚Äôs &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.copenhagenize.com/2010/12/ultimate-bike-lane-snow-clearance.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;fun post about the little tractors&lt;/a&gt; which I always like to show people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course part of the Danish pavement clearing is to encourage people to use public transport and cycle/walk as much as possible (if you commute by bike, then you don‚Äôt want to have to find an alternative when the weather changes - in Copenhagen that would be a nightmare because of the numbers involved) . But also think of the accidents people don‚Äôt have - there will always be a rise in the number of A&amp;#x26;E visits when slippery pavements mean that even younger people have nasty falls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully my thoughts don‚Äôt come across as too opinionated; I don‚Äôt think its easy to argue against clearing pavements. To businesses worried about being sued for actually making pavements safer: you would clear the icicles off your shopfront, wouldn‚Äôt you?&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[New rail photographs published]]></title><description><![CDATA[I've uploaded some new rail photos]]></description><link>https://jens.raaby.co.uk/journal/2010/12/new-rail-photographs-published</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://jens.raaby.co.uk/journal/2010/12/new-rail-photographs-published</guid><pubDate>Thu, 09 Dec 2010 19:39:21 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I have recently uploaded a collection of rail photographs from the last year or so.

&lt;p&gt;I even fell into that trap myself with the predecessor to this blog. I am almost ending doing the same with this one. &lt;!-- more --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem as I see it, is that the writer needs a message they want to share with the world. It might be something they found out which might be useful for others, like my last post. It might be commentary on an event, some music, a film‚Ä¶ Some people just like sharing thoughts and things they have created, like photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blog is a great platform for this, but it often feels like you need to put a lot of time and effort into posts. If your purpose is marketing, then of course quality is important, but so is frequency of updates. I‚Äôve just started using Twitter which liberates me from the burden of time when I want to share something. I don‚Äôt feel I have to sit articulating my thoughts for long periods; a simple character limit sets you free. Facebook to a certain extent also allows this micro-blogging approach, but on a much more social, interactive level, and in my case with a wall around what I am saying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I end up spending around 10 minutes on Twitter every few days, spewing out a few thoughts. It‚Äôs refreshing to get something out there; I feel I‚Äôve created something. The blog sits there with half a dozen half started posts, building up like my Google Reader unread count - it feels like hard work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm wondering where I will end up going with this blog. it might just be links to other things I‚Äôve created. It might be the odd photo I want to share, but Flickr does that for me. All I know is that I feel I need a platform to publish on, not necessarily daily, or weekly; but somewhere that people can go if they want to know what I have to say.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Installing Windows on a Mac with Multiple Partitions]]></title><description><![CDATA[Recently the new version of Mac OS X, Lion, was released to the public.

&lt;p&gt;Recently the new version of Mac OS X, Lion, was released to the public. This version features a new recovery partition which cannot be setup if you have multiple HFS partitions as described in this tutorial. I will look into this in August, but for now, be cautious if you want to upgrade to Lion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I ordered my iMac I chose the 2TB hard disk option, planning to contain my entire photo dataset and my digital music and TV recordings on this main drive.¬†For the past few years I‚Äôve always separated my data from applications and settings using partitions. On the Windows side this has made reinstalling the operating system and restoring from backups far easier. So naturally when I received my iMac I immediately created a Data volume and started copying in my photos and media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-problem&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#the-problem&quot; aria-label=&quot;the problem permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The problem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward a few weeks, and I decided to try installing Windows to try the few games I do play on my shiny new quad core computer. To my dismay, the Boot Camp Assistant immediately said I had to delete my extra partition. That would not do - I could not see any reason why I should not have multiple HFS+ partitions as well as an NTFS partition for Windows. It turns out that the GPT scheme that Apple use (and increasingly many PCs will start using as hard disks grow above 2TB) does not have a limit on the number of primary partitions, and does not support extended (‚Äúlogical‚Äù) partitions. The system used by older PCs uses the MBR (Master Boot Record) scheme which allows 4 primary partitions only. Boot Camp Assistant sets the partition layout to have 3 partitions - a compulsory EFI partition, the Macintosh HD partition, and the Bootcamp partition, which is set up with a hybrid GPT/MBR scheme that allows Windows versions later than XP to boot. Since you are forced to use the MBR scheme, there is room for 1 more primary partition. Some may wish to use it as a shared FAT32 volume, but that is less practical when you have large files. I already used this slot for my Mac data (which is at least readable in Windows), so there was no need to do anything with it other than shrink it to allow room for a further partition.&lt;!-- more --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-i-then-installed-windows&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#how-i-then-installed-windows&quot; aria-label=&quot;how i then installed windows permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;How I then installed Windows&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first step in my case was to resize the large Data partition to make room for my new NTFS partition. I used Apple‚Äôs Disk Utility, which was not as intuitive as I expected. To resize a partition, you need to select the disk drive itself, then go to the ‚ÄúPartition‚Äù tab. There you can select a partition and either drag its corner to resize, or type in a new size after selecting it. I resized my data partition to leave 80GB for Windows 7 (which is more than enough when it isn‚Äôt the primary OS on the machine).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I then created a new partition in the empty space for Windows itself. To do this, you click a little ‚Äù+‚Äù and then choose to format as MS_DOS (FAT). I wish Apple would natively support NTFS writing and formatting, but there is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tuxera.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Tuxera&lt;/a&gt; for that. Make sure you label the partition to aid finding it in the Windows installer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Next, I had to prepare the MBR record for the disk so that Windows would ‚Äòsee‚Äô it. The most important tool in the whole process is &lt;a href=&quot;http://refit.sourceforge.net/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;rEFIt&lt;/a&gt;. This tool can be installed on a USB stick or your main Mac partition. I chose the former, and rebooted, holding down Option to bring up the boot selector. Once in rEFIt, the shell can be used (run gptsync.efi) or choose the partition editor. This basically sets the MBR up so Windows will be happy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At this point, it‚Äôs time to install Windows. I tried booting a USB stick that normally installs my custom Windows 7 ISO, but that didn‚Äôt work on the Mac. I tried a DVD of the same image, and that worked fine. The only real manual step was to format the partition I had created as NTFS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once Windows was installed (note that when the installer reboots you need to hold down Option to allow you to boot from the Windows partition) and hopefully working, the final step is to insert the Snow Leopard installation DVD to install drivers (to enable reading of HFS partitions amongst other useful things like graphics drivers). I used the DVD that came with my iMac (so it‚Äôs reasonably up to date (July 2010)), and if you have an older version then there is an updated download from the Apple site.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That was basically it. Windows 7 is awesome on such a big screen, but I still prefer OS X for getting things done (excluding gaming and .NET programming).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope Google indexes this and somebody else finds it useful ;).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Welcome]]></title><description><![CDATA[Welcome to the blog]]></description><link>https://jens.raaby.co.uk/journal/2010/09/welcome</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://jens.raaby.co.uk/journal/2010/09/welcome</guid><pubDate>Wed, 29 Sep 2010 16:49:41 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Please visit the photography and web design pages to find out about previous work.
