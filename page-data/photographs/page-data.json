I got started because it was something to do when staying in Denmark, and I have a certain fondness for the railways there - it’s a much smaller network than in Britain and there are still plenty of locomotive hauled passenger trains. Back in 2002 there were also plenty of goods trains with diesel haulage, which have been disappearing in favour of lorries ever since.</p>\n<p>Updates:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>07/12/10 - I’ve uploaded a few British train photos taken during the last year.
