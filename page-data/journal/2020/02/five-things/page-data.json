My least favourite was Joker, which I just couldn’t get behind. Parasite was a great combination of comedy and tragedy.\nSee Mark Kermode’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/09/parasite-review-bong-joon-ho-tragicomic-masterpiece\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">review over at The Guardian</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2-pollen-bakery\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#2-pollen-bakery\" aria-label=\"2 pollen bakery permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>2. <a href=\"http://pollenbakery.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Pollen Bakery</a></h2>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/fivethings/1-pollen.jpg\" alt=\"Pollen Shakshuka and Tahini pastry\">\nAnyone who has visited me in Manchester will have been dragged to Pollen at some point.\nIt’s my favourite bakery, making everything with sourdough (yes, even the pastry). It sates my desire for Danish pastry (or wienerbrød as it is known in Denmark) and they even sell Danish style rye bread.\nI’ve scaled back my home baking recently, but it’s always a treat to head to Pollen for some brunch and have a chat with them about different flours and styles of bread. (I do miss the time when they were based in a railway arch and I would regularly queue for half an hour on Saturday morning to get the elusive Cruffin).</p>\n<h2 id=\"3-acm-membership\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#3-acm-membership\" aria-label=\"3 acm membership permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>3. <a href=\"https://www.acm.org/membership\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">ACM Membership</a></h2>\n<p>For a while I kept acquiring dead-tree programming books, many of which I only gave a cursory read.\nI eventually joined O’Reilly Safari on one of their big discounts.
