A lot of the Netflix programmes seem designed to be binged on, but occassionally you want something more substantial, that warrants leaving a break between episodes to ponder things.\nI thoroughly recommend this series. It introduces you to the French DGSE (equivalent to Britain’s MI6 or the CIA), following an agent who has returned from a life undercover.\nThere is a lot of spycraft, some romance, and all in all it’s very enjoyable.\nMy French is very rusty, so I rely on subtitles, but as with many foreign series, you don’t notice after a while. And I find I like the sound of French even when I don’t understand!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nouvelobs.com/series/20200328.OBS26720/une-serie-un-style-le-bureau-des-legendes.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Here’s a recent French article</a> recommending it.

Good numeracy will help with the more academic side of things (particularly the algorithmic coding interview) but day-to-day programming work is more about communicating ideas in an abstract language.\nI don’t really think of myself as very good at maths, but I think I was alright at learning languages back at school (and I wish I had kept it up - I suppose it’s never too late…).\nMaybe that explains to some extent why I do alright as a programmer; I do find it interesting to learn about new programming languages and paradigms, but solving mathematical puzzles isn’t really my cup of tea.</p>\n<p>Whether this study holds in general, I’m not sure, but it is interesting all the same, and should give hope to people who think they can’t learn to program because they aren’t very mathematical.\nThe original article from Nature is free to read <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-60661-8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">online</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5-we-need-a-massive-surveillance-program\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#5-we-need-a-massive-surveillance-program\" aria-label=\"5 we need a massive surveillance program permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>5. <a href=\"https://idlewords.com/2020/03/we_need_a_massive_surveillance_program.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">We Need A Massive Surveillance Program</a></h2>\n<p>This is a bit of a controversial one. I generally listen to what Maciej Cegłowski has to say (I’m also a big fan of his <a href=\"https://pinboard.in\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Pinboard</a> service).\nLast week I mentioned Harari’s article on the difficult choices ahead if we allow governments to invade privacy in the name of an everlasting emergency.\nThis article argues that we really could do with using the surveillance capability we have now.\nWe have a dilemma of choosing between hurting people because the economy is damaged, or hurting people by letting the virus spread. If we have a vaccine, then this dilemma is solved.\nBut without a medical solution, we’ll have to continue with some level of containment strategy for the foreseeable future. If we could leverage the surveillance system that exists now in the private sector, that could massively help.\nAs ever, it raises questions about the surveillance technology that already exists.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/journal/2020/03/five-things-6","tagSlugs":null},"frontmatter":{"date":"2020-03-30T22:00:00.000Z","description":"Wherein I recommend some more cultural things, a study about programming ability and another item about the virus","tags":null,"title":"Five things - 30/03/2020","socialImage":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/journal/2020/03/five-things-6"}}}
