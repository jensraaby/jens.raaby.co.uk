He‚Äôs gone from being a public service broadcaster economics journalist to being a quite a partisan Labour supporter, but with lots of interesting ideas. I need to get back to reading <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/PostCapitalism-Guide-Future-Paul-Mason/dp/1846147387\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Postcapitalism</a>‚Ä¶</p>\n<p>This week we had a new budget in the UK, the first since 2018.\nLots of the press was lavishing praise on the govenment for spending some money, turning its back on austerity.\nMason takes a more nuanced approach, talking about how this budget relates to Labour‚Äôs policies such as the National Investment Bank and plans to invest in social housing.</p>\n<blockquote>... there‚Äôs a growing consensus that by slashing interest rates and printing money, central banks are contributing to the low-growth environment that Britain and other major countries are trapped in...\n<p>We need a whole new economic model ‚Äì and there is no way we can get one unless Treasury and central bank economists cut the crap they have been talking for more than a decade. Mainstream economics is opposed to borrowing to invest in skills, or to boost public health outcomes, because these are not classed as ‚Äúinvestments‚Äù.</blockquote></p>\n<p>It‚Äôs worth a read. There‚Äôs a lot going on in the financial world right now, and it feels like we‚Äôre at a tipping point of sorts.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3-early-thoughts-on-a-pandemic\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#3-early-thoughts-on-a-pandemic\" aria-label=\"3 early thoughts on a pandemic permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>3. <a href=\"https://samharris.org/podcasts/191-early-thoughts-pandemic/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Early Thoughts on a Pandemic</a></h2>\n<p>Last week I mentioned being at the QCon conference.
