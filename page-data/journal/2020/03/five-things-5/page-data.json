They get a variety of people on, but the core team of Adam Fleming, Chris Mason, Laura Kuenssbery and Katya Adler are regularly together. Recently the BBC’s medical correspondent has been on, and there are other ‘experts’ who come to discuss topical news.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3-yuval-noah-harari-the-world-after-coronavirus\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#3-yuval-noah-harari-the-world-after-coronavirus\" aria-label=\"3 yuval noah harari the world after coronavirus permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>3. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/19d90308-6858-11ea-a3c9-1fe6fedcca75\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Yuval Noah Harari: the world after coronavirus</a></h2>\n<p>I’m a fan of Harari’s books, and it’s good to see his take on what’s going on.\nThe gist of this article is that society could be changed irrevocably if we aren’t careful, with surveillance measures being used to enforce lockdown.\nHe argues we should prioritise both health and privacy, and not enact emergency powers that could be left in place indefinitely.\nThe article also discusses the importance of unity on a global level. With the US not taking a position of leadership, and making rash isolationist decisions like banning incoming EU travel without any prior discussion, we are going to find it hard to coordinate efforts to overcome the pandemic. Harari argues that there needs to be information sharing, pooling of medical resources, economic cooperation and agreement on travel policies.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4-rudys-pizza\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#4-rudys-pizza\" aria-label=\"4 rudys pizza permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>4. <a href=\"https://www.rudyspizza.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Rudy’s Pizza</a></h2>\n<p>Back in 2016, we had an Italian from Naples join the team, who said that Manchester wouldn’t have real pizza.\nFortunately we proved him wrong, because Rudy’s was set up specifically to make really good Neapolitan style pizza.\nBefore discovering Rudy’s, I hadn’t really tried it before. Now I find it hard to enjoy other styles of pizza. A particular highlight is the “Ancozzese”, a white pizza with smoked mozzarella, sausage and friarelli, a special kind of broccoli (I believe the authentic name for this pizza is ‘salsiccia e friarelli’).\nGenerally all the toppings are authentic, so no chicken, beef mince or pineapple in sight.\nNow that restaurants are shut, they have started doing takeaway, which I managed to try last week. Hopefully they’ll pull through the restaurant lockdown.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5-simon-wardley-on-twitter\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#5-simon-wardley-on-twitter\" aria-label=\"5 simon wardley on twitter permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>5. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/swardley\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Simon Wardley on Twitter</a></h2>\n<p>Many people will have heard of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wardley_map\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Wardley Maps</a>, which are gradually permeating management types, especially in technology.\nThe basic premise is that in order to work out a sensible strategy, it is necessary to work out the most visible/valuable user need you are trying to solve, and then following the dependencies of this down to the less valuable things. On the other axis, you position things by how commoditised they are. For example, a pizza ordering system where you can choose toppings might need to be purpose built, but the electricity that supplies to pizzeria is solved on an industrial scale so there isn’t any point in trying to build a custom power generator.\nAnyway, I recommend following @swardley on Twitter, as he has interesting takes on a lot of things. He often posts dialogues with a fictional person “X”, which are quite entertaining.\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/swardley/status/1238093970187661313\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Here’s a long thread</a> of 80 tweets on the response to Coronavirus - <a href=\"https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1238093970187661313.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">(read it in one unrolled view)</a>.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/journal/2020/03/five-things-5","tagSlugs":null},"frontmatter":{"date":"2020-03-23T22:00:00.000Z","description":"Coronavirus takes over.","tags":null,"title":"Five things - 23/03/2020","socialImage":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/journal/2020/03/five-things-5"}}}
