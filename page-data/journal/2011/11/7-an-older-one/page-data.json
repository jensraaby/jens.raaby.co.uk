Instead I dug out a photo from July and did some editing with Snapseed, a handy but fairly limited photo editor which has Nik’s control point technology for local adjustments.\nThe subject is a glasswinged butterfly in Chester zoo. It was a couple of weeks after I had purchased my macro lens and my first encounter with an interesting stationary insect.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/20111106-201042.jpg\"><img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/20111106-201042.jpg\" alt=\"20111106-201042.jpg\"></a></p>\n<p>This coming week I won’t be posting every day. I will try to write something but I don’t intend to subject myself to a daily posting schedule just yet.
