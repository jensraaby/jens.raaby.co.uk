At the time I felt like I was unlikely to think of anything more interesting to draw, so I just doodled a bit. One of the reasons for this ‘week of images’ is to force myself to create something every day. It doesn’t have to be something I think of as great, but the more time I put in, the more rewarding it is. </p>\n<p>I wanted to draw a “thing” today. I tried to draw my iPod using just 2 colours, but that was a little dull. So I skimmed through the photos on my iPad and was inspired to try a mushroom and continue with Monday’s theme of smallish natural objects. This was a chance to practice using the brushes and smudge tool in my favourite drawing app, Procreate. I don’t feel it’s quite finished,  but it might be interesting to come back in the future and improve things.</p>\n<!-- more -->\n<p><a href=\"/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/20111103-212146.jpg\"><img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/20111103-212146.jpg\" alt=\"20111103-212146.jpg\"></a></p>","fields":{"slug":"/journal/2011/11/4-mushroom","tagSlugs":["/tag/image-week/","/tag/sketch/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2011-11-03T21:23:46.000Z","description":"Drawing a mushroom","tags":["image-week","Sketch"],"title":"#4 - Mushroom","socialImage":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/journal/2011/11/4-mushroom"}}}
