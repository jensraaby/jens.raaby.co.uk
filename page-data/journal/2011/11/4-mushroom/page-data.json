At the time I felt like I was unlikely to think of anything more interesting to draw, so I just doodled a bit. One of the reasons for this ‘week of images’ is to force myself to create something every day. It doesn’t have to be something I think of as great, but the more time I put in, the more rewarding it is. </p>\n<p>I wanted to draw a “thing” today. I tried to draw my iPod using just 2 colours, but that was a little dull. So I skimmed through the photos on my iPad and was inspired to try a mushroom and continue with Monday’s theme of smallish natural objects. This was a chance to practice using the brushes and smudge tool in my favourite drawing app, Procreate. I don’t feel it’s quite finished,  but it might be interesting to come back in the future and improve things.</p>\n<!-- more -->\n<p><a href=\"/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/20111103-212146.jpg\"><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 960px;\"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 73.33333333333334%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAAPABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFwAAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIEA//EABYBAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIBA//aAAwDAQACEAMQAAABkTOnJTCFH//EABsQAAICAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAgMQESEi/9oACAEBAAEFAq4bJcwpNF/mw//EABYRAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEQEf/aAAgBAwEBPwETJ//EABURAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAR/9oACAECAQE/AUf/xAAYEAACAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABEBEgMf/aAAgBAQAGPwKkDF//xAAZEAEBAQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAABABFBIWH/2gAIAQEAAT8hAq8hq7M+OX2A22//2gAMAwEAAgADAAAAEGwf/8QAFhEAAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEBEh/9oACAEDAQE/EICH/8QAFhEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAER/9oACAECAQE/EJGn/8QAGxABAAMBAAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQARIVExQXH/2gAIAQEAAT8QJQfAHsqxMWJoewRenM9y5YBHb+xdz//Z'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <picture>\n        <source\n          srcset=\"/static/26f8f8cb5e45c4c3f208d283f983229f/8ac56/20111103-212146.webp 240w,\n/static/26f8f8cb5e45c4c3f208d283f983229f/d3be9/20111103-212146.webp 480w,\n/static/26f8f8cb5e45c4c3f208d283f983229f/e46b2/20111103-212146.webp 960w\"\n          sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\"\n          type=\"image/webp\"\n        />\n        <source\n          srcset=\"/static/26f8f8cb5e45c4c3f208d283f983229f/09b79/20111103-212146.jpg 240w,\n/static/26f8f8cb5e45c4c3f208d283f983229f/7cc5e/20111103-212146.jpg 480w,\n/static/26f8f8cb5e45c4c3f208d283f983229f/6a068/20111103-212146.jpg 960w\"\n          sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\"\n          type=\"image/jpeg\"\n        />\n        <img\n          class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n          src=\"/static/26f8f8cb5e45c4c3f208d283f983229f/6a068/20111103-212146.jpg\"\n          alt=\"20111103-212146.jpg\"\n          title=\"20111103-212146.jpg\"\n          loading=\"lazy\"\n          style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        />\n      </picture>\n    </span></a></p>","fields":{"slug":"/journal/2011/11/4-mushroom","tagSlugs":["/tag/image-week/","/tag/sketch/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2011-11-03T21:23:46.000Z","description":"Drawing a mushroom","tags":["image-week","Sketch"],"title":"#4 - Mushroom","socialImage":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/journal/2011/11/4-mushroom"}}}
