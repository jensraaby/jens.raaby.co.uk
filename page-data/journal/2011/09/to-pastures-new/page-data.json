I’ll be working near Cambridge and staying there during the week. Hopefully the early winter will not be as bad as last year as I am hoping to do most of my commuting by bike.</p>\n<p>This week I’m going to be revising Java, algorithms and data structures during my free evenings. I have a day of interviews coming up at a large software company, and it’s wise to be familiar with a lot of the first year computer science material.</p>\n<p>I’ll be using a mobile hotspot for my internet during the week.
