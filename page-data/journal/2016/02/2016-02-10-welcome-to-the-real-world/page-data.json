It’s one of the largest cities in the UK, probably about the same size as Copenhagen, where I spent most of 2012 up to early 2014.</p>\n<p>I came here to work for the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">BBC</a>, the national broadcaster.\nI joined a department in the process of moving from London to Manchester. That meant my team inherited around 8 software systems (varying quite considerably in size).\nWe spent the first half of 2015 taking over from the previous team and recruiting new people.</p>\n<p>Since then we’ve mostly worked on replacing a legacy system (last updated in 2003!). All of this has been a great learning experience; both in terms of day-to-day software development and all the things that go around that (people, communication in a large distributed company, new requirements hitting us from different directions…).</p>\n<p>We chose to use the Scala programming language (also used in a few of our inherited projects). That’s been an interesting experience, after my university years involving the odd bit of Haskell, Erlang and lots of Matlab.</p>\n<p>I’m hoping to draw out some topics of interest and write about them here, so keep an eye out.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/journal/2016/02/2016-02-10-welcome-to-the-real-world/","tagSlugs":null},"frontmatter":{"date":"2016-02-10T20:33:25.000Z","description":"Keeping a blog up to date is hard!","tags":null,"title":"Welcome to the real world","socialImage":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/journal/2016/02/2016-02-10-welcome-to-the-real-world/"}}}
