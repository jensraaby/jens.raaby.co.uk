I have been building websites for almost 2 decades now; it's a fantastic
combination of the technical and the artistic. I particularly enjoy constructing
visual designs using the latest technology, while trying to communicate in a
simple, appealing way.

In the past I have built websites by request to fit around my other work and
studies. My clients are typically small businesses. If you are interested in working with me with an online project,
please feel free to get in touch.

I have experience with developing and setting up content management systems
(CMS), and I like to build websites which are from the outset search engine
optimised (SEO). I can write copy and take photographs as necessary.
