## 1. [Mildreds](https://www.mildreds.co.uk/)

I'll kick this week's picks off with a favourite restaurant.
I think I first went to Mildreds 5 years ago this week, when I was in London for QCon last time.
I've since been back a number of times, most recently this week. My pictures of the food don't really do it justice, so I won't add them here - you can see their own ones on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/mildredsrestaurants/?hl=en).
Every time I've eaten there I've been extremely impressed, and I'm not surprised they have a long waiting time in the evenings.
I was surprised how little on the menu was non-vegan - it was limited to Halloumi, optional cheese on burgers, and dairy milk in coffee.

Highlights for me were the [chick'n kebab with a preserved lemon marinade](https://www.instagram.com/p/B2gzRJhFoae/), and the chocolate cherry lava cake (the [picture here](https://www.instagram.com/p/B2wHJP7FM17/) is a slightly different recipe, but similar theme with the coconut cream and cherry).

## 2. [Paul Mason: The Budget showed Labour has won the spending debate ‚Äì but a new economic model is needed](https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/economy/2020/03/budget-showed-labour-has-won-spending-debate-new-economic-model-needed)
I started following Paul Mason a while ago. He's gone from being a public service broadcaster economics journalist to being a quite a partisan Labour supporter, but with lots of interesting ideas. I need to get back to reading [Postcapitalism](https://www.amazon.co.uk/PostCapitalism-Guide-Future-Paul-Mason/dp/1846147387)...

This week we had a new budget in the UK, the first since 2018.
Lots of the press was lavishing praise on the govenment for spending some money, turning its back on austerity.
Mason takes a more nuanced approach, talking about how this budget relates to Labour's policies such as the National Investment Bank and plans to invest in social housing.

<blockquote>... there‚Äôs a growing consensus that by slashing interest rates and printing money, central banks are contributing to the low-growth environment that Britain and other major countries are trapped in...

We need a whole new economic model ‚Äì and there is no way we can get one unless Treasury and central bank economists cut the crap they have been talking for more than a decade. Mainstream economics is opposed to borrowing to invest in skills, or to boost public health outcomes, because these are not classed as ‚Äúinvestments‚Äù.</blockquote>

It's worth a read. There's a lot going on in the financial world right now, and it feels like we're at a tipping point of sorts.


## 3. [Early Thoughts on a Pandemic](https://samharris.org/podcasts/191-early-thoughts-pandemic/)

Last week I mentioned being at the QCon conference. This morning I had an email saying that 2 attendees had tested positive for Covid-19, and now I'm going to be working from home for the next week.

There's a lot of hysteria about the virus at the moment. My local Aldi has got very low stock of a lot of products (all toilet paper and kitchen roll is gone, many fresh vegetables, minced beef, tinned veg, bread, and eggs are running low).

This podcast was recommended by [@ricburton](https://twitter.com/ricburton) and it is an interview with Amesh Adalja from Johns Hopkins.
It's a good overview of this pandemic and how it compares with previous viral outbreaks. 
I do feel somewhat reassured about it having listened to this, although it sounds like the health systems around the world aren't that prepared to deal with it.

## 4. [How to write usefully](http://paulgraham.com/useful.html)
A lot of people dismiss Paul Graham, but one thing he does well is writing essays.
This meta-essay covers a recipe of sorts for writing. 
Importance, novelty, correctness and strength.
I hope at some stage to get back to writing longer posts, and I'll bear in mind this advice if I feel like venting my opinions.

## 5. [Gogo Penguin](https://gogopenguin.co.uk/)
I seem to be a sucker for jazz trios with piano, bass and drums.
Ever since I saw Esbj√∂rn Svensson Trio live, I've looked for other groups with a similar dynamism.
Gogo Penguin do reference EST on their first album with the track "Seven Sons of Bjorn", but they never quite live up to the Swedish group.
That said, I do enjoy some of their music, and their latest track is [worth a listen](https://gogopenguin.lnk.to/GogoPenguin).

Here's a couple of other good tracks that I picked out:
* [Weird Cat](https://open.spotify.com/track/5QJTodesVBIAGoh1QkgCNY)
* [Hopopono](https://open.spotify.com/track/1hW0VwYPGPzkz2CIXVIY78)
* [Garden Dog Barbecue](https://open.spotify.com/track/1A4iI9Ho0OG0lhXiiiWKWm)

Thanks to [Steven](https://twitter.com/stevebakh?lang=en) for recommending them to me about 5 years ago!
