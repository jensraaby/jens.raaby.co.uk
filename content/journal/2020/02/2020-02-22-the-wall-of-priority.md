- all software projects have a need to balance priorities and make sure important technical problems (tech debt) don't build up too much
- developers often raise tickets to postpone addressing issues, usually because the amount of effort required is non-trivial
- but it is often frustrating being one of those developers. if you aren't involved in prioritisation (it's often just the tech lead and product manager) then you might feel like the debt is growing and you may be right - but you probably also lack insight into what all the business value tasks might be.
- I raised this issue at work a couple of years ago and our product manager came up with an ingenious solution - visualising the entire backlog on a wall in the office, so we could at a glance see what was most important, and what was most urgent.
- This 2D representation captures something which you can't quite get in JIRA or Trello with a simple ordering.
- We found there tend to be clusters of tickets. The bottom left of the wall is referred to as the boneyard. We realised that the line separating this from the rest of the stories is actually quite high up.
