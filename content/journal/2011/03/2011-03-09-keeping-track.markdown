I've been wondering if using this blog is a good way to log the films I've watched recently. I occasionally forget that I've seen a film, or what it's about, so it would be nice to have a way to keep track. I'll be on the look out for Wordpress Plugins that integrate with IMDB, but if anyone reading this has any suggestions, please feel free to tweet (@jraaby) or comment here.
