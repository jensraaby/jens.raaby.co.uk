If you don't happen to use a car or bike for travelling long distances, it's often quite usefulÂ to keep on top of you travel itinerary. This app ([homepage](http://tripit.com)) is available for iOS, Android and Blackberry and basically reads your travel confirmation emails (e.g. train ticket bookings, flight confirmations, car rentals) and builds it into a useful all-in-one resource for knowing where you need to be. Highly recommended.
