description: "On working in Cambridge and interview prep."
---

Things have been quite busy lately; it seems impossible to relax when you have too much time on your hands.

Tomorrow I'm starting a contract that fills the rest of the year. I'll be working near Cambridge and staying there during the week. Hopefully the early winter will not be as bad as last year as I am hoping to do most of my commuting by bike.

This week I'm going to be revising Java, algorithms and data structures during my free evenings. I have a day of interviews coming up at a large software company, and it's wise to be familiar with a lot of the first year computer science material.

I'll be using a mobile hotspot for my internet during the week. So far it's proven faster (on upload) than standard ADSL so I may write up my experiences in the next few weeks.
