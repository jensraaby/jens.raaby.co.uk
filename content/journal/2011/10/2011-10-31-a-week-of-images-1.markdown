This week I'll be trying something slightly different - I will post an image made each day - either a photo or a sketch. The only limit is that it is created or uploaded with my iPad.

Today it was 10pm before I got started, so I just did a quick sketch of some leaves. The burst and then fade of colour in the trees around us are my favourite autumnal subject. This 5 minute sketch will serve as a beginning; simple, quick and with a theme I can develop later.![20111031-222814.jpg](/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/20111031-222814.jpg)
