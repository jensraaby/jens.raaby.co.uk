You may notice I have recently experimented with the typefaces used on this site. I am currently too busy with another website to work on this site's re-design but a recent project demanded a particular font family be used and Typekit happened to have it available. I consider the value of the Typekit packages to be quite good considering what you get so I am going to let my subscription continue.

Last week I was using [Garamond](http://typekit.com/fonts/garamond-premier-pro-display) for headings and this week I've switched to the classic [Futura](http://typekit.com/fonts/futura-pt) for headings, with [FF Dagny](http://typekit.com/fonts/ff-dagny-web-pro) being used for body text.
