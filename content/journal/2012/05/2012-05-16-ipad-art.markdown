description: "Some sketches from the iPad"
---

I never got round to posting these sketches I made last year when I first got my iPad. They are not masterpieces, but I can show them to people and not feel ashamed. The tools and working methods available on the iPad drawing apps are very impressive, especially with an app like Procreate where you have very advanced brush controls, layer blending and so forth.
